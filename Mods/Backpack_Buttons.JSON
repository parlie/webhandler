  "modDescription": "A very useful Backpack Buttons mod by KhaineGB for 7 Days to Die.\n\nMoves buttons to the left of the inventory window (so sort is where it used to be) and uses custom icons rather than the ones provided by TFP.\n\nThere is also a box with numbers in it. This box locks the amount of slots shown (default 0) so they are not affected when you click any of the buttons. It caps at 45, which is the entire, vanilla-sized backpack.\n\nThis is just an XML mod + some new button icons so you can clearly see what they are. No SDX needed. KhaineGB has also tested it with his [60/96 slot bigger backpack mods](https://7daystodiemods.com/bigger-backpack-mod-60-96-slot-with-without-food-water-bar-on-hud/) and it’s working fine.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* Updated Backpack Buttons V1\\. It still uses the new code, AND has the lockable slots included. However, KhaineGB removed the backpack icon on the left, moved all the buttons to the left, moved the “Inventory” text to the middle of the bar and put back my custom icons.\n* Backpack Buttons V1 also had a folder rename so it loads FIRST, which means backpack modlets should then work with it.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/khaines-modlets-a19/-/archive/master/khaines-modlets-a19-master.zip?path=0-KHA19-BackpackButtons)** for **A19**  \n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/khaines-modlets-a19/-/archive/master/khaines-modlets-a19-master.zip?path=KHA18-BackpackButtonsV2)** v2 for **A19** _(As above, but uses vanilla icons which is better for servers.)_  \n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/khainemodlets/-/archive/master/khainemodlets-master.zip?path=KHA18-BackpackButtons)** for **A18**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19558-khaines-a19-modlets-bigger-backpacks-backpack-buttons-hp-bars-etc/).\n\n**Credits:** [KhaineGB](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/khainegb/)",
