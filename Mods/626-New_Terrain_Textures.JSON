  "modDescription": "The purpose of this mod is to allow appending new terrain [textures](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-textures/) to the game terrain texture array. One thing to note, is to match the blockw and blockh for all your textures or you will see size issues with the vanilla textures. TormentedEmu recommend using either 1, 4, or 8 depending on how large you want the textures in game.\n\nThe mod also comes with a sample terrain texture bundle and you can pull the blocks out from the creative menu.\n\n## Important\n\n* Adding new terrain textures requires [SphereII Legacy Distant Terrain](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/SphereII/SphereII.ModsA19/tree/19.3/SphereII%20Legacy%20Distant%20Terrain).\n* This is a DMT mod. So requires [DMT Modding Tool](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/13037-dmt-modding-tool/).\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/TormentedEmu/7DTD-A19-DMTMods/tree/master/TE_NewTerrainTextures)**\n\nPlease let her know if you have any questions, or have any problems/bugs with it. She is usually found on [Guppycurâ€™s Discord](https://discord.gg/mh3J3dS). Her nickname on the Discord is V.\n\n**Credits:** [TormentedEmu](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/tormentedemu/)",
