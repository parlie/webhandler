  "modDescription": "Enables you to insert and fire two bolts of your choice, if you have this mod attached to your crossbow.

The [recipe](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-recipes/) itself is expensive, because it will make you perform double damage – and even lets you fire two exploding or flaming arrows too.\n\nP.S.: There is a mod, simply extending the magazine size. This was too OP for Claymore, so he decided to do his own variant.\n\nCompatibility: A18+\n\n[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/gkxclx24l1wrx62/Claymore_Double_Bolt_Mod.zip)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
