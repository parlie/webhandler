  "modDescription": "Ever thought how can zombies climb ladders? With these two different mods, zombies can’t climb ladders.\n\n## No Ladder Climb\n\nA 7DTD mod that simply switches it so **all zombies** can not climb ladders. Mod tested with **vanilla** zombies but also works with Khelldons Bad Company Modlet and with Mumpfy’s New Zombies.\n\n## Ladder Control\n\nFull Ladder control mod that allows you to stop certain types of zombies from climbing ladders or allow them if thats your thing. Works with vanilla [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) only at present and may need modification if The Fun Pimps add new zombies. This mod has no support for Mumpfy’s additional texture zombies or Khelldons Bad Company zombies.\n\n**Important Note:** If you want to include any of his vehicle mods or other mods in a ‘mod overhaul’ please do him the courtesy of asking for permission first… when given you must give the due credit to himself and any other modders that may be credited under the “Credits & Additional Credits” sections if any. Also you are not allowed to extract any unity files without his permission either, if there has been an alpha change then wait and files will be updated for the new alpha version as soon as he possibly can.
