  "modDescription": "TSBX removed the 25% Headshot that ShoudenKalferas was using from [his modlet collection](https://7daystodiemods.com/headshot-multiplier/). So ShoudenKalferas copied and revised the code a bit. It provides 25% boost to headshots and also scales the damage to headshots based on the difficulty of the game.\n\n* Difficulty 2 = No change\n* Difficulty 3 = 25% Increase\n* Difficulty 4 = 75% Increase\n* Difficulty 5 = 100% Increase\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/XelaNull/7DTD-Bag_Bellows_Headshot/tree/master/Headshot_25)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17502-60-slot-bag-faster-bellows-25-headshot/).\n\n**Credits:** [ShoudenKalferas](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/shoudenkalferas/), TSBX",
