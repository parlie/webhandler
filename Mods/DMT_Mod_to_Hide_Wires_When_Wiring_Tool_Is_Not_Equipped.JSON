  "modDescription": "On the heals of ocbMaurice’s last mod, here comes the next. Small excerpt from his bigger [electricity](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-electricity/) overhaul mod.\n\nThis mod hides all power wires, except trip wires and shock wires, when the wiring tool is not equipped.\n\nIdeally we would need to know the type of block for the right and left position of each wire, but that information doesn’t seem to be available. But we know that wires between trip or shock posts have a different pulse color, so we simply look for that color to show or hide wires.\n\nThis mod needs [DMT](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/13037-dmt-modding-tool/) (Harmony) loader to be present!\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/ElectricityNoWires/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/25422-dmt-mod-to-hide-wires-when-wiring-tool-is-not-equiped/).\n\n**Credits:** [ocbMaurice](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ocbmaurice/)",
