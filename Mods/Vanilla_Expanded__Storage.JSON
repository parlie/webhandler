TSBX will do his best to keep up with the latest stable game releases, but barring any block name changes, there shouldn’t be any problems.\n\n## Credit and Thanks\n\nHe want to specifically acknowledge Guppycur, Mumpfy, Sphereii, Xyth, Khaine, HaidrGna and Snufkin for all of their guidance and help making this real!\n\n## Installation\n\nExtract the “Vanilla Expanded – Storage” folder from the linked file below into your 7 Days to Die/Mods directory.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/TSBX-7D/VanillaExpanded-Storage/archive/main.zip)**\n\nIf you like TSBX’s mods, feel free to show your appreciation via a [donation](http://paypal.me/theTSBX).\n\nHaving problems with the mod?
