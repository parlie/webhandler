  "modDescription": "Ever thought how can zombies climb ladders? With these two different mods, zombies can’t climb ladders.\n\n## No Ladder Climb\n\nA 7DTD mod that simply switches it so **all zombies** can not climb ladders. Mod tested with **vanilla** zombies but also works with Khelldons Bad Company Modlet and with Mumpfy’s New Zombies.\n\n## Ladder Control\n\nFull Ladder control mod that allows you to stop certain types of zombies from climbing ladders or allow them if thats your thing. Works with vanilla [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) only at present and may need modification if The Fun Pimps add new zombies. This mod has no support for Mumpfy’s additional texture zombies or Khelldons Bad Company zombies.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/Ragsy2145/alpha-19-modlets/-/archive/master/alpha-19-modlets-master.zip?path=Ragsy_No_Ladder_Climb)** No Ladder Climb  \n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/Ragsy2145/other-7-days-to-die-mods-and-modlets/-/archive/master/other-7-days-to-die-mods-and-modlets-master.zip?path=Ragsy_Ladder-Control)** Ladder Control\n\nThe forum topic of the mods [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11266-ragsy-s-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Ragsy2145](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ragsy2145/)",
