  "modShortDescription": "This is Survager's first mod. Now, to repair weapons and complex tools, you need not a simple repair kit, but parts of these items.",
  "modDescription": "This is Survager’s first mod. He is very confused that the details of weapons and tools are now used only to create these things.\n\nIt also bothers him that a simple repair kit is used to repair complex things, such as machine guns, a drill and a chainsaw.\n\nThe uselessness of parts of [weapons](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) and tools is especially visible at the end of the game, when we already have top-end items.\n\nSurvager decided to change this a bit.\n\nNow, to repair weapons and complex [tools](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/), you need not a simple repair kit, but parts of these items.\n\n## Warning\n\nThis can greatly change your approach to survival.\n\nYou will think about whether to sell this rifle or better to break it.\n\nIs it worth it to use a drill/chainsaw now, or is it better to use an ax/pickaxe, since there are no parts for repair.\n\nIt may happen that your favorite weapon becomes unusable, and even the dealer simply does not have repair parts. In this case, you will have to buy expensive weapons or tools from the merchant in order to break them in order to receive parts for repair.\n\nTo compensate for the complexity of the repair, the degradation of the changed items is reduced by 5 times. It still requires balancing, we will test together.\n\n**Update to A19**\n\n* Changed reqiured to repair new weapon and tools\n* Language file changed (ENG/RU). Now the description contains information about what can be used to repair the item.\n\n## Changelog\n\n**v1.2:** Increased the rate of degradation of all items that require parts for repair from 0,2 to 0,4\\. Now you will need to repair items more often.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11VCJbAlsBUTNcWN2sHmCukwwkXFycA4p?usp=sharing)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://github.com/Orsey/Mod-Survager-Rework-Repair-Items/archive/master.zip)** for A18\n\nIf you appreciate Survager’s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](https://www.patreon.com/survager).\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/20467-modlet-rework-repair-weapons-and-tools-for-a19-parts-are-now-needed-for-repairs/).\n\n**Credits:** [Survager](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/survager/)",
