  "modDescription": "Aerial got tired of collecting canned goods only to never really use them for much of anything, so this mod rearranges the Master Chef recipes to make cooking more interesting. Early game cooking uses canned goods heavily, giving value to all those scavenged cans. Late game cooking focuses on crops, once youâ€™ve had time to establish a garden.\n\nOverall, [food](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/) is a little bit more challenging in the early game. Let him know what you think of the balance, especially on high population servers. His play testing has all been 1 or 2 person worlds.\n\nPlease note that this mod is not vegetarian/vegan friendly as the vegetable stew has been repurposed.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8k9gyog50iiikc/MasterChefRedux%20A19%20v1.1.zip?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23862-master-chef-redux/).\n\n**Credits:** [Aerial](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/aerial/)",
