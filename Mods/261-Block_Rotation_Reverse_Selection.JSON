  "modDescription": "We all know how frustrating it is when you’ve just passed the block rotation you wanted and have to click through another 20 rotations until you get the you wanted! w00kien00kie solved this problem for us.\n\nHe has uploaded a mod to fix this problem in the 7 Days to Die. It will now reverse on LeftShift+LeftMouse click instead of Reload+LeftMouse. It actually uses the command bound to the Run key so if you’ve rebound this you will have to use this key instead of LeftShift.\n\n**Reminder:** Be aware this is a dll change and hence counts as full overhaul mod (even if it is just 1 file) and hence youll need to run the non EAC exe to run the game. (i.e. 7DaysToDie.exe)\n\n**Warning:** This is a simple change and shouldnt affect game saves but only use at your own risk.\n\n**Setup:** Overwrite the following file (preferably in a copy of the vanilla of game) : \\\\7 Days To Die\\\\7DaysToDie\\_Data\\\\Managed\\\\Assembly-CSharp.dll\n\n[Download](https://gitlab.com/wookienookie/a18_vanilla_mods/blob/master/7DaysToDie_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15717-block-rotation-reverse-selection/).\n\n**Credits:** [w00kien00kie](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/w00kien00kie/)",
