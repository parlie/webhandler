  "modDescription": "A new workstation that mines slowly the selected mineral. Uses gas a material and augers as tool. Needs at least 1 auger to work, with a max of 3\\. The quality and amount of augers used decreases the [mining](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-mining/) time to a max of 30 min per stack of 1000\\. Generates a bit more heat than a forge, so be careful.\n\n## Changelog\n\nUpdated for A20 by Magejosh. (Unofficial update.)\n\n**What’s Changed**\n\nRecipe costs and output counts for crafting in the autominer scale based on the tier of tools used and levels in the advanced engineering perk.\n\nThe autominer crafting recipe scales in ingredients and crafting time based on levels in advanced engineering, and unlocks at level 3 of advanced engineering.\n\nThe autominer crafting recipes have had crafting type tabs added to make quick sorting to the recipe you want easier. There is the general resources tab with all resources recipes listed. Then the Desert Resources tab for oil shale. Then The Ammo Making Resources for lead, brass, nitrate, and coal. Then the construction resources tab for stone, clay, and iron.\n\nThe autominer now has description localization describing in game what is needed to unlock it and what tools it needs to operate.\n\nLastly there will be an incidental improved crafting speed of 1% per level in advanced engineering for all recipes unlocked by that perk.\n\nAs well that also means this mod will conflict with any mod that removes the advanced engineering perk, removing it’s ability to function.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FdnKOecJVu223_aK5lj5ewlc3OrSqtMg/view?usp=sharing)** for A20  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Snufki-n/Snufkin_Modlets/tree/master/Snufkin_Autominer)** for A18\n\n**_Alpha 19 Version:_** Updated for A19 by Abasiyanik.
