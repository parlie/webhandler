  "modDescription": "This mod makes the [weather](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weather/) more challenging to deal with. It makes the assumption that the apocalypse recently occurred and the air is very dirty. The winds of nuclear annihilation have not calmed or something like that.\n\nLots of wind will make you want to want to be inside. A very low chances of having **remotely nice** weather. High chance of rain. More variations in temperature, so clothing will matter more.\n\nThe dense **smoke/sand/fog** particle effects are in every [biome](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-biomes/) (even underwater) so if its too much (visually or FPS wise) there are 2 override mods to this mod to lessen them. If you choose to use one, load only one:\n\n* [Punishing Weather Effects Medium](https://7daystodiemods.com/punishing-weather-effects-medium/)\n* [Punishing Weather Effects Light](https://7daystodiemods.com/punishing-weather-effects-light/)\n\nIn addition there is another mod you can add that makes it even more challenging. The name is from the xml file it modifies (weathersurvival.xml): [Punishing Weather – Survival](https://7daystodiemods.com/punishing-weather-survival/)\n\n## Other Addons\n\n* [Punishing Weather Rain More](https://7daystodiemods.com/punishing-weather-rain-more/)\n* [Punishing Weather Temp More in Burnt Forest](https://7daystodiemods.com/punishing-weather-temp-more-in-burnt-forest/)\n\n**Warning:** This mod likely does not play well with other biome weather modifying mods because it deletes the **weather** node on each biome that has it before adding its own. This was way easier than trying to make the modlet friendlier for other modlets by overriding all the similar/non unique environment nodes in the weather section as sometimes there’s only one, sometimes there more.\n\n## Changelog\n\nBugfix: A few values were a little off in a biome. Not a big change.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a19/tree/main/Doughs-PunishingWeather-Core)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a18/tree/main/Doughs-PunishingWeather-Core)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
