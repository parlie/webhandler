  "modDescription": "This mod adds a Super Auger, essentially a buffed version of a normal auger with higher block damage. It uses the [auger](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/) model in-game and the auger icon with a green tint.\n\nThe recipe is unlocked by Miner69r level 5, although Hulvey originally planned to make a schematic for it. The tags were not working for some reason and he was getting the yellow error text. The Super Auger recipe consistently requires 10 raw diamond, and much more steel and motor tool parts than its vanilla counterpart.\n\nTLDR\n\n* Super Auger go munch munch on rocks and dirt\n* Unlocked by Miner69r lvl 5\n* Recipe needs more steel and motor tools parts + 10 diamond\n* Kind of needs more features to be relevant but its ok(He will call it a WIP)\n\nYou are free to do whatever you want with this within The Fun Pimps’ rules.\n\nClick download all in the top right and unzip the file, then place it in a “Mods” folder in your 7 days game folder.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cq2ntKvSMOXF0A6x-kw7Ca5iVQHwMYWq?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21829-super-auger-modlet/).\n\n**Credits:** Hulvey",
