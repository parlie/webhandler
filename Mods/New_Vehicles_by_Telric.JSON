  "modDescription": "This mod adds a few new vehicles. It adds a car with 5 different texture variations, two helicopters, and a biplane with 5 different texture variations.\n\nThe [car](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-car-mods/) is moderately fast but can’t go up inclines very well.\n\nThe helicopters work like helicopters. Pressing forward (the W key) will make you go upwards. You can tilt with the space bar and C button which will make your forward key propel you in that direction. You can also hover if you tap the forward button and no tilt.\n\nThe plane works like a plane. It has a very wide turning radius so turning on the spot is impossible. It is very fast so it’s a great way to get across the map quickly.\n\n**Installing:**  \nThe mod does come with localisation. Just copy the contents of the included file into your localisation.\n\n[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cufemrq8odcspkg/Telrics%20Vehicles.zip?dl=1)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12713-telrics-vehicles/).\n\n**Credits:** [Telric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/telric/)",
