  "modDescription": "Hi to all. Here I bring you a mod that allows you to craft any gun parts that you need. But be aware I haven’t made it that easy. You will have to craft a Templates first on the forge that needs a crucible… so I made it possible to craft [gun](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) parts but not that easy to do in the beginning of a new game.\n\nI am planning to add a second mod in the future that adds schematics to the Templates so you can choose which one to download.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXCnin7xo7vSf4PmWSnAvRLeBtakwgMV/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** FEAR Gaming",
