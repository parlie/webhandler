Go and give that [zombie](https://7daystodiemods.com/zombie-mods/) wasteland world that is 7DTD world some good old Christmas spirit by decorating your base as if there was still any hope to come back to what it was before. Have a hohoho Christmas, until Santa’s comes, and takes your soul.\n\nWe have snowmen, or as we are in 2019, snowpersons or snowpeople or whatever.\n\nThere are some pointless giant candy canes.\n\nPresents! Presents for everybody, but in that world you probably shouldn’t expect anything better than an expired cat [food](https://7daystodiemods.com/food-mods/) can.\n\nChristmas socks, mostly to remain empty.\n\nAnd of course we have a Christmas tree. And there are some lights.\n\nAnd for those who still have some fuel left for those generators!
