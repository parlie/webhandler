  "modDescription": "Find and crash a party to stop a spy set out on a mission to kill every party goer there. Help Leah Martini figure out which attendee is the spy and take them out quietly with a syringe of poison. Choose carefully though. The spy is carrying a bomb ready to detonate at any moment if thereâ€™s a commotion. Killing an innocent party-er will definitely make the spy trigger the bomb!\n\nRequires restart. Requires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.4 b7\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbsbq59ebmjtskc/TelricsSpyPartyA19.zip?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19976-telrics-a19-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Telric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/telric/)",
