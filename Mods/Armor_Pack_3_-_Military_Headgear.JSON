  "modShortDescription": "The military has crumbled and left you to fend for yourself. The least they could do is leave behind some sick helmets and masks for you to wear.",
  "modDescription": "I’m sure you’re as frustrated as me with this outdated [clothing](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-clothing/) system and their apparent desire to dumb it down to make our players feel even less like they’re unique and custom to us.\n\nI am releasing these mods to hopefully show TFP that players WANT custom characters and variations of items that they can hobble together with treasures from the wasteland, creating a truly unique character and base.\n\nThe military has crumbled and left you to fend for yourself. The least they could do is leave behind some sick helmets and masks for you to wear.\n\nNote that with all clothing/[armor](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-armor-mods/) mods, you CANNOT preview this in your character outfit screen. This is pretty useless in SP. However, it is equipped on you and in multiplayer or on a bike, you will see it.\n\nThis serves to help your crew look badass and get more protection.\n\nYOU MUST LOOT THESE, YOU CAN’T CRAFT THEM. This is for realism / immersive purposes.\n\n16 new helmets and 11 new masks. Helmets have varying levels of protection but mostly resemble the existing army helmet specs.\n\n## Helmets\n\n* PAGST Helmet (Grey / OD)\n* 6B47 Helmet (OD / Ranger)\n* ZSH-1 Helmet\n* MICH (Grey/Ranger)\n* FAST Helmet (Khaki/OD)\n* ACH (Desert MARPAT / Grey)\n* Altyn Helmet (Grey / Dark Blue / Black)\n* Tank Crew Helmet (OD / Ranger)\n\n## Masks\n\n* Head Wrap/Neck Scarf (Tiger Stripe / M81)\n* Balaclava (Woodland / Black)\n* Head Wrap/Bandana (Ranger/Coyote)\n* Bandana (AOR2/M81)\n* Concealed Operator (Googles/comms/head wrap/neck wrap) (AOR2/Khaki/M81)\n\nALL ASSETS PURCHASED AND LICENSED TO SMITTYLV.\n\nJoin my dedicated server with my private and experimental mods by visiting [my website](https://smittylv.com/).
