  "modShortDescription": "These files are a 7 Days to Die generated world where there is only one biome: Wasteland.",
  "modDescription": "Eric’s friend Grand Spartan asked him for a [world](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/) that only one biome: Wasteland. Some people watching the stream asked if they could have a copy of the world.\n\nThese files are a 7 Days to Die generated world where there is only one [biome](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-biomes/): Wasteland. He has also tweaked the generation to include all the ore types. Oil Shales are not present in normal wasteland biome.\n\n## How to Install\n\nThe world is available as a multipart ZIP file. He had to split the ZIP since GitHub only file smaller then 100 MB.\n\n1. Download all the files in the same folder and double-clic on the .ZIP file to extract.\n2. Copy the Wasteland Only Valley folder that you’ve just extracted in your **7 Days To Die\\\\Data\\\\Worlds** folder. You’ll have to check with your Steam client to know where 7 Days is installed.\n3. Start 7 Days and create a new game using the Wasteland Only Valley.\n4. Play the game.\n5. Profit (Maybe, mostly horrible death by vaultures and bears. Don’t say you were not warned.).\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Laotseu/7dtd-spantan-multiplayer-bundle/tree/master/Worlds)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19462-motorcyclealterations-v10-alpha-18/).\n\n**Credits:** [Eric Beaudoin](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/eric-beaudoin/)",
