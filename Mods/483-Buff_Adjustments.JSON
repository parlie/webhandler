  "modDescription": "This changes the injury times for the broken arm, broken leg, sprained arm, sprained leg, concussion, and lacerations. The sprains are changed to 5 minutes and the broken, concussion, and laceration are changed to 30 minutes.\n\nIf you want to change it the time then edit the black numbers for the respective buff (the buff times are in seconds so if you want to have an X minute buff then multiple it by 60).\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1bXK4L0Fdx1S94-alkI1OmBdtLz4ieENr)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21700-rickyralph-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Rickyralph](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/rickyralph/)",
