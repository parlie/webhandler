  "modDescription": "This mod adds a working elevator to the 7 Days to Die.\n\nAn elevator model in the game. It is very particular and Guppycur will not be changing it.\n\nThis is not a sdx mod, there is no code, so it is not fancy.\n\nIt will move an elevator from one floor to a second floor. That is it. This is essentially a door and using some trickery and colliders it’ll move you up and down. Nothing more.\n\nIf you have a base that has floor, space, space, space, floor, and enough space to add your own elevator shaft (the elevator takes up 3 wide, 7 high, 3 deep) then this mod for you!\n\nThis elevator mod works with Alpha 17 and Alpha 18 game versions.\n\nGuppycur highly recommend using concrete plates for the front cover, and [build](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-building-materials/) your shaft as needed. You just need to leave a 3×3 empty space in between the walls.\n\n**Shaft Requirements:** 10 High (includes floor and ceiling), 5 Wide (1 and 5 are the left/right walls), and 5 Deep (1 and 5 are the front/rear walls)\n\nFor your convenience there are two included prefabs a pre-made elevator shaft and an elevator shaft with elevator in this mod. Simply copy the contents of **modnam/prefabs to your data/prefabs folder**\n\n[Download](https://gitlab.com/guppycur/guppymods/-/archive/master/guppymods-master.zip?path=Guppycur%27s_Elevator)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9144-guppycurs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/)",
