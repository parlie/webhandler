  "modDescription": "Farm Life Mod, the original farming overhaul and animal husbandry mod for 7 Days to Die, all fixed up and currently being maintained by War3zuk. As specified this version will work on Alpha 20.3 B3, This is very early in development so DO NOT use this in any Serious Game! You have been Warned that Most Updates will Require restarting (Maybe)\n\nDEMMERS was the last person to work on this back in Alpha 18, This has now been taken over by himself War3zuk to fully update it & bring it to Alpha 20.3 B3, Mod loads without errors, Workstations have been simplified were needed, Hungry Animals have been deleted & completely rebuilt along with their respective code… All patch notes included so you can see whats been done so far…\n\nWar3zuk FarmLife v3 Enhanced, the farming overhaul adding a multitude of cooking stations, multi-levelled crafting for foods, animal husbandry and more. So long as you have the correct perks and then follow a somewhat correct path you shouldn’t have any issues working your way through the mod. If for some reason you come across an issue report it so that he can get it fixed.\n\n## Animals\n\nWar3zuk is actively updating & fixing as much as possible, The original author said he would look into providing the original unity files which will allow the updating of all Trees, Plants & Animal models… It will allow War3zuk to update many if not all of the old Unity files, he has corrected offset for placement, animations for all bar 2 models have been sorted along with recipes, Blocks & much of the old code. Plants are currently set at Default as they all need updating, Trees are also set to default as they were also broken & in need of updating. All this will be done in due time.\n\nNew animals currently include:\n\n* Beehive ([honey](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/))\n* Horse (bone, leather, glue)\n* Pheasant (eggs, feathers, meat)\n* Sheep (wool, meat)\n* Turkey (eggs, feathers, meat)\n\n## Animal Workstations\n\nAnimal workstations are a continuation of Mayics concept, with new animals added. Again, none have animations and are place-holders for the time being. They are also the source of a “breeding” system. He didn’t really know how to do this, so he added “cryo” containers to be found in loot that can then be used with the Animal workstation to create that type of animal.\n\nNew [animal](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-animals/) workstations currently include:\n\n* Beehive\n* Elk\n* Horse\n* Pheasant\n* Sheep\n* Turkey\n\n## Crops\n\nWith the combination of the two [farming](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-farming/) mods, there were some duplicate plants. Some have been changed to other plant types, while others have been discarded and not used. The “crop” plants have been recoded to use TFP’s growing method, with 56 plants available. All have at least 1 useful recipe.\n\n## Trees\n\nMost of the recipes for UbB require certain types of wood. (Example: Dark furniture requires Walnut, Clear requires Maple, White requires White Oak) making [Trees](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-trees/) more important.\n\n## Workstations\n\nAs mentioned, with the combination of the two farm mods, there were duplicates of some workstations. All have been re-evaluated and recipes changed accordingly. He didn’t completely delete the unused models from the Mod, and they are still able to be crafted, but with no recipe requirements tied to them.\n\n## Recipes/Quests\n\nThis is one of the areas he hasn’t done much with yet, regarding the originals. There are currently 1517 recipes and 292 quests in the Mod. He hasn’t gone through everything, but all quests are available in the Farm Table. He also has to go through all of the Food recipes and categorize them. There is a “starter” quest item that will give basic [quests](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-quests/) to get started with Farm Life if you decide to use it. A few of the new food items are just place-holders and don’t have buffs/stats yet.\n\n**Important:** The zipped file (War3zuk FarmLife v3 Enhanced VP) Is for playing the Mod in a vanilla game, The mod is built to run along side his Overhaul so had different settings for windows.xml & XUI.xml That patch sets it all back to Vanilla so it runs, If you add that zip file to his overhaul it will break the things mentioned.\n\n**Important:** Started this for 2 reasons, 1st, The original Author, If you have issues with War3zuk doing this please mention it & he will remove & send you the updated files he has so far which is only around 7 hours work… Still a ways to go to fully update this… & 2nd This Mod deserves to be working on Alpha 20.3 & he couldn’t find any info on this being updated past 14 months ago & Roland had closed all forum pages related to this…\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is likely to have many issues that he has not found or addressed, Play at your own risk, This Repo is for his benefit of updating & testing… Also its worth noting that he doesn’t has access to the original Unity Packages so he can only update the main xml… PS There is no 100% Guarantee that he will be able to complete this so it is what it is right at this moment…\n\n## Changelog\n\nWar3zuk FarmLife v3 Enhanced Alpha 20.5 B2 Stable\n\n**Version 1.16**\n\n* **_(new)_** Removed Loot ID34\n* Edited
