  "modDescription": "This mod adds 2 more mod [slots](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-more-slots/) for items BUT the “tiering” of the item still determines the mod slots available and the tiering was changed only for items with an existing tiering -> slots of\n\n**Item Tier** / **Mod Slots**  \n1,2,3,4,5,6 / 1,1,2,2,3,4\n\nThe tiering -> slots was changed to\n\n**Item Tier** / **Mod Slots**  \n1,2,3,4,5,6 / 8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nHowever, in items.xml you can comment out the above setting and select this setting, which is more in line with the “vanilla” game\n\n**Item Tier** / **Mod Slots**  \n1,2,3,4,5,6 / 1,2,4,5,7,8\n\n**Note:** For items with a different tiering -> slots, no changes were made. Also: If an item has 0 mod slots in vanilla, it will still have 0 slots.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a19/tree/main/Doughs-UI-Add-2ModSlots)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/), joshwar99",
