  "modDescription": "Here is a quality of life ‘server side only’ mod called ‘Oak’s Pet Animals, Guards, and Farm Jeep’ by Oakraven with kind assistance from Dayhawk Mod.\n\nThank you also to Dre for giving it a good run through to check for functionality and potential issues.\n\nThis mod provides:\n\n**1) 9 Pet Animals** – These include Boar, Rabbit, Stag, Chicken, Pig, mini Bear, Wolf, Coyote, and Doe. (These animals show no fear when approached and will stay within their confines. It is strongly recommended to always have 3 blocks above the highest perimeter point because the animals can climb up onto objects and each other and will be over the wall before you can notice.)\n\n7 are purchasable from the Trader’s with a starting base price of 800 or found in plane supply drop crates and use the Quest system to switch to a place-able animal. These include Boar, Stag, Pig, mini Bear, Wolf, Coyote, and Doe. 2 are only found by using a Coop for the chickens or a Trap for the rabbits.\n\n**2) 5 Guards** – Guard Hell Bear, Guard Hell Boar, Guard Hell Wolf, Guard Hell Lion, and Guard Rabbit. Additional human Guards are undergoing a little more tweaking and will be released at a later date.\n\nAll 5 are purchasable from the Traders with a starting base price of 800.\n\n**3) A Vehicle** – Farm Jeep (This is a miniature version of the 4×4 Jeep and is designed to be used for very local journeys due to its slow speed. Tractoresque.)\n\n## Pet Animals\n\n### Purchasing and Supply Drops\n\nVisit the trader and check the [traps](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-traps/) and tools section. On this occasion the trader was very generous with offerings and the animal icons have a description of what animal is being offered. The pet [animals](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-animals/) have been integrated into a default group and on some occasions you will get a lot of choice and on other occasions nothing. The base price of 800 has been lowered to reflect skill and buffs.\n\nHere is how Arramus place a Pet Boar he purchased at a later time using the Quest feature. First, perform a ‘Read’. Accept to Release the Pet Boar for Placement. A Quest Started prompt will appear and it will automatically be completed. Check you inventory for a ‘dog house’ icon and the name of the animal available. Place the animal on ground just as you would a vehicle and stand back. Incorporating a feature found in the Dayhawk Mod (thank you), a tile will appear on the ground which in turn will spawn the animal placed.\n\nIf the animal drops onto the tile, the tile will break and a cobweb will appear to finalise the process. If the animal doesn’t drop onto the tile, you can always walk on it and it will break. There are occasions where you may get lucky and a second animal will spawn. You may also get unlucky and nothing spawns; however this is incredibly rare and based on what they have experienced so far, blanks are less than 1 in 50, whereas doubles, and even triples on one occasion occur 1 in 10\\. He expect this depends on netcoding, latency, or any other factor relating to server processes.\n\nYou can either harvest the animal for meat and other resources, or simply allow it to have a sedate life of roaming.\n\nPet animals have been integrated into default supply drop settings and will be chosen from a select list of supply drop groups.\n\nUpon finding a Supply Drop Crate, you may get lucky and find a pet animal.\n\nThere are also 2 Pet Animals that cannot be purchased or found. These include the Pet Chicken and the Pet Rabbit. oakraven introduces a method using default features in a novel way as follows:\n\n**a)** Construct a Rabbit Cage Trap or Chicken Coop and place them. The Chicken Coops can be placed next to each other but the Rabbit Traps need some spacing.\n\n**b)** Make some Chicken Feed and Rabbit Feed in your campfire and take them to your Chicken Coop and Rabbit Trap respectively.\n\nIn this case, right mouse click and it will change the Chicken Coop status.\n\nOnce receiving Chicken Feed the Chicken Coop moves to its Nesting Stage.\n\nAnd finally it is time to harvest. We can always receive feathers and eggs and regularly receive Pet Chickens.\n\nPet Chickens are placed exactly the same as other Pet Animals.\n\nThe chickens are prone to resting on ledges above the ground and your imagination can take that wherever you want it to.\n\nPet Rabbits follow the same system beyond the reward and housing.\n\nMake some Rabbit Feed. Take it to your Rabbit Trap and right click. The Rabbit Cage Trap is Baited and Set.\n\nHere’s one they trapped earlier.\n\nActivate and Release as with other animals. And should you ever lose your pets and have the skill in place, crouch.\n\n## Guard Animals\n\n### Purchasing\n\nJust as with the Pet Animals, the Traders will stock Guard Animals. The Guard Animals can be purchased for the same price and placed exactly the same as Pet Animals using the quest system. The Guard Animals will remain passive in the spot you place them until a Zombie gets to close. The guard animals can be used to protect your Pet Animals, general base protection, or even during a Blood Moon event.\n\nAn unwelcome guest. 2 Animals Guards; Guard Hell Wolf and Guard Rabbit are released using the tile placement system and very quickly recognise the threat. After opening the shutter, the zombies attempt to enter the farm compound and are met by the Guard Animals. Arramus got lucky on this occasion and 2 Hell Wolves spawned from a single tile.\n\nThe skirmish ensues. One of the Hell Wolves was overcome and is ready to be harvested. The Guard Animals that survived will see their health restored.\n\nThe Guard Animals also fare well during a Blood Moon event. Four Guard Animals remained until first light. Players will receive no XP for Guard Animal kills.\n\nThere are 4 additional human Guards that are currently being tweaked for a future build. There was an issue with the Trader compound causing NRE for certain classes and that needs to be tweaked to ensure they function well with the few classes that are compatible.\n\n## Vehicle\n\n### Farm Jeep\n\nThe farm jeep is your [tractor](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/). It is pretty slow but will get you from A to B without running down your stamina. It fits the concept and can be constructed on the Workbench with less resource demand than a regular vehicle due to its limited functionality. It’s just a bit of fun. And is scaled to match pathways. Carries 2 players…\n\nThere will undoubtedly be updates in time, but this is a fully functional ‘[farming](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-farming/)‘ mod and may serve you well as a break from looting, questing, and skirmishing.\n\n## Changelog\n\nHere is a Guard update for the Mod which allows players to place guards as non moveable Turrets.\n\nThere are 8 new guards as follows, in no particular order: Sim, Lizzy, Dre, Fox, Bandit, Bandit Foxy, Leader, and Bow Man.\n\nAs each guard remains static, they can be placed strategically when collected. They cannot be purchased from a Trader but can be found in Air Drop Supply Crates. Placement is exactly the same as for any other entity through the quest and reward process.\n\nThe guards HP is relatively low at only about 150\\. However, it is possible to heal the guards using bandages or first aid kits by placing the healing tool in your hand and using right click.\n\nAs the HP is relatively low and they will quickly be wiped out if a horde can reach them, they have unlimited ammo. However, they shoot in a conservative and controlled manner and fire a shot every few seconds. They do not replace the power of default turrets at all but will complement your defences.\n\nThese have been fully tested for stability on dedicated servers but will benefit from feedback to see if the HP or shot damage requires tweaking.\n\nThank you to Darjusz and the community at mjota.net who are running a variety of Snufkin Mods as well as this Pet and Guard mod. Their server has seen a new World added and is well worth a visit.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you’ve never installed a mod before it is necessary to create a mod folder in the main directory or in an area suggested by your server host if they have modified the installation. Simply make a new folder called **Mods** (with a capital **M** to reflect standard nomenclature). If you drag the mod folder directly out of the zipped file it can be placed directly into the **Mods** folder and the game will look in there as you launch your World. If you allow your unzip function to extract the folder, it may make another unnecessary folder and place the mod inside it. This will not be recognised by the game/server if you place it in the **Mods** folder like this. Please take it out of the extra folder level. The top layer will be a single folder and in the second layer you will see a **ModInfo.xml** file with or without additional folders depending on the mod. This will become elementary once you’ve launched a few mods.\n\nThe magic of this mod is that is only needs to be installed in the server/person who has launched the main environment that others join. It is a technical work of art. Enjoy.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/arramus/Pet-Animals-and-Guards-A19-2021Jan01/archive/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/22947-oaks-pet-animals-guards-and-farm-jeep/).\n\n**Credits:** [Arramus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/arramus/), Oakraven, Dayhawk, Dre",
