  "modDescription": "Here is a simple Quality of Life server side only mod that allows players to combine 5 [food](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/) items that are not currently part of a recipe into a meal:\n\n* Cat Food\n* Miso Soup\n* Chicken Soup\n* Canned Chicken\n* Pears\n\nThis is very easy for Clan/Community/Group server hosts to modify and customise to reflect a name more fitting with their own group.\n\nWithin the mod ‘Config’ folder is a Localization file which allows hosts to change the standard name into something more descriptive. In addition it allows the item to receive a more detailed description.\n\nIt currently looks like this:\n\n```\nKey,File,Type,UsedInMainMenu,NoTranslate,english\n\nfoodClanCooking,items,Food,,,Clan Cooking,,,,,\nfoodClanCookingDesc,items,Food,,,\"Throw together all the junk that usually has no recipe to make a nutritious, delici...(maybe not)...highly nutritious hot pot.\"\n```\n\nSimply change Clan Cooking to be something you like, for example, regular communities visiting the forum: Catman ‘ZombieShack Stew’, Ti2xGr ‘Geek Gaming Gutbuster’ (although Geek Gaming has already taken recipes far beyond this and is well worth a visit), and a newer member Saminal ‘Outback Decay’ (the actual group name and nothing may need to be changed who also applies multiple quality of life modifications on multiple servers in house).\n\nThe description can easily reflect the type of server you run or connect to the meal title.\n\nThe meal itself cooks quickly and combines to offer about 25% more than the sum of the individual items as well as a stamina buff.\n\nCollect the items and a Cooking Pot\n\nRead the description as optional\n\nCheck the Stats\n\nTop Up when needed\n\nFor further customisation, it is possible to change the icon and icon colour tint in the items.xml file if you wish.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/arramus/Clan-Cooking/archive/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23286-clan-cooking/).\n\n**Credits:** [Arramus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/arramus/)",
