  "modShortDescription": "7 Days to Die car respawning mod for A19/A18 version. Also respawns buses and army truck. Destroying will stop the vehicle respawning.",
  "modDescription": "In 19.1 Stable the Fun Pimps added 3 new vehicles. This adds them to the [respawning](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-respawn/) of the modlet. If you are using a19 the one below that works for a18.3 will work for it.\n\nA18.3 stable b4 version of car respawner.(This version also works with a19.0 Stable release.) Also respawns buses and army truck. Anabella has changed it to not use an air block and to be one of the wheels with rim laying on ground so that you can tell it is not a normal tire to chop. She also used metal material so that it takes a few more hits to destroy it. Destroying will stop the vehicle respawning for anyone wanting to build where the vehicles are.\n\nHas been checked and works for 19.2, 19.3 and 19.4.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/Anabella00geek/7D2D-Vehicle-Respawner-19.1/archive/master.zip)** for A19.1, A19.2, A19.3 & A19.4  \n**[Download](https://github.com/Anabella00geek/7D2D-Vehicle-Respawner/archive/master.zip)** for A19.0 & A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/4054-car-respawning/).\n\n**Credits:** Anabella",
