  "modDescription": "This mod adds a Banjo [melee weapon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-melee-weapons/) to the 7 Days to Die! Does slightly less base damage than the sledgehammer. Has a power swing that does extra damage and has a decent chance to dismember, but uses a lot of stamina. Supports the same weapon mods as the sledgehammer.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/bdubyah/Mods---A18/-/archive/master/Mods---A18-master.zip?path=Banjo)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11875-bdubyahs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Bdubyah](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/bdubyah/)",
