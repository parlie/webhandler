  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod replaces the vanilla 2x, 4x, and 8x optics with versions that utilize picture-in-picture rendering for a more modern feeling firearm experience.\n\n## Notes\n\nAll replacement scopes have functioning illuminated reticles. The red portions seen in the above screenshots are very visible in low-light conditions.\n\nPerformance impact is negligible, at least on his i7 Y500 with SLI 650ms.\n\nCertain [weapons](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) have the front sights visible within the optic. Without the use of risers this is unavoidable, but Sykriss may release a version that adds risers where needed to remove the front sight from the FOV.\n\nThis modlet, and his other ‘replacement’ modlets, do not actually overwrite any of the vanilla files and can be installed/uninstalled on an existing save with zero ill effects. They should also be compatible with other modlets that alter weapon properties as long as this mod loads first (which is why the names start with AAA).\n\n## Changelog\n\n* 1.0: Initial release\n* 1.01: Minor adjustment to 2x scope materials\n* 1.02: Slightly increased zoom level of 2x scope, minor adjustments here and there.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\nExtract archive to mods folder.\n\n**[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/te2c6w17hk67854/PIP_Vanilla_Optics_1-02.zip/file)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17712-picture-in-picture-vanilla-optics-replacer/).\n\n**Credits:** [Sykriss](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/sykriss/)",
