  "modDescription": "Hello folks. Here I bring you a mod that allows for crafting of parts! This gives you the ability to craft parts that you would normally need to scrap [weapons](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) and tools for or buy. And this is not just limited to parts by itself, as I have added the ability to craft solar cells and solar banks as well. Feel free to protect generate as much [electricity](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-electricity/) as you need now, so I do hope this helps you folks be able to use this to your advantage.
