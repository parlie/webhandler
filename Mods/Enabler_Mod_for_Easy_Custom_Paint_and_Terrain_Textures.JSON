  "modDescription": "ocbMaurice would like to introduce a mod he has created last week that might be interesting to other modders. A mod that enables other mods to “easily” add custom block paint and/or terrain [textures](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-textures/). It reduces the needed work to a proper unity3d resource file and the accompanying xml.\n\nHaven’t tested it that thoroughly yet, so there might be a few bugs left. On the other hand it already supports automatic scaling for half/quad texture sizes.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/OcbCustomTextures/archive/refs/tags/0.1.0.zip)** Custom Textures  \n**[Download](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/OcbCustomTexturesDemo/archive/refs/tags/0.1.0.zip)** Custom Textures Demo\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/28269-enabler-mod-for-easy-custom-paint-and-terrain-textures/).\n\n**Credits:** [ocbMaurice](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ocbmaurice/)",
