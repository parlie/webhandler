  "modDescription": "If you remember, that jail doors once worked. The doors were working was the last time in Alpha 16 version. So Claymore ported the original recipe over to 7 Days to Die Alpha 18 version. Same recipe, same harvest loot, same everything.\n\nOne exception: To make them 100% work again, Claymore had to remove the multiblockdim. But doesn’t really matter, since it simply works great. And he currently added powered jail doors too. Simply add 2 electrical components and craft the powered variants. If you have unlocked it like all powered doors need to.\n\nCompatible with Alpha 18 game version.\n\n**Changelogs**\n\n* 1.0.1: Collision: Bullets don’t collide anymore with the jaildoor.\n* 1.0.2: Added: Powered Jaildoors. Gated like other powered doors.\n* 1.0.3: Added: Secondary recipe for Powered Jaildoors: If you already have normal jaildoors crafted, simply add 2 electrical components to it in the workbench.\n* 1.0.4: XPATH correction: Somehow worked, but missed an important thing.\n* 1.1.0: Major bugfix: Powered ones could be crafted without unlocking them via perks or recipe.\n* 1.2.0: Major bugfix: Unlocking via schematic didn’t work properly.\n* 1.2.1: Update for post 18.3 versions: Localizationfix\n* 1.3.0: Missed the repair material. Fixed. **_(New)_**\n\n[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vnvwemtknjyyscr/Claymore_Working_Jaildoors.zip)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
