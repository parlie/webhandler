  "modDescription": "I’m sure you’re as frustrated as me with this outdated [clothing](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-clothing/) system and their apparent desire to dumb it down to make our players feel even less like they’re unique and custom to us.\n\nI am releasing these mods to hopefully show TFP that players WANT custom characters and variations of items that they can hobble together with treasures from the wasteland, creating a truly unique character and base.\n\nReady to freak out anybody who loots with you? Find one of these unique masks in the world and equip it in the cosmetic slot of your helmet to take on a new identity!\n\nNote that with all clothing/[armor](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-armor-mods/) mods, you CANNOT preview this in your character outfit screen. This is pretty useless in SP. However, it is equipped on you and in multiplayer or on a bike, you will see it.\n\nThese masks are item modifiers so that you can use a regular helmet and just have these replace the helmet visually.\n\n## Masks\n\n* 2 gas masks\n* Horned welders helmet\n* Macabre mask\n* Joker clown mask\n* Android mask\n* Evil groot mask\n* Clay golem mask\n* Alien predator mask\n\nALL ITEMS ARE LICENSED TO SMITTYLV.\n\nJoin my dedicated server with my private and experimental mods by visiting [my website](https://smittylv.com/). You can also see up-to-date blog posts as I update WIP projects and talk about the modding process as I go through it. You can also donate if you’d like to contribute to more Unity assets being brought into 7DTD.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109e8eoEg7Y9qRIhknRhkzmm-SeLBh0IX/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [smittylv](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/smittylv/)",
