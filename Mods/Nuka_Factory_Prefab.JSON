  "modDescription": "When Bdubyah was making the [Nuka Colas mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/nuka-colas-mod/) for 7 Days to Die, he knew he wanted to do more Fallout stuff, so he decided to build the Nuka Factory from Fallout 3!\n\nIt’s as close as Bdubyah could get it, seeing as how many exteriors and interiors didn’t really line up in the original game. He left off a room or two due to size constraints, but overall it’s pretty close to the original. Works for quests as well.\n\nThere will be 2 versions, Nuka Factory that requires the Nuka Colas mod as it will add in custom blocks and some other goodies. And also a vanilla version, Nuka Factory Vanilla, if you’d rather not have to use the mod along side the prefab.\n\n[Download](https://github.com/bdubyah/Prefabs/archive/master.zip)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11875-bdubyahs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Bdubyah](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/bdubyah/)",
