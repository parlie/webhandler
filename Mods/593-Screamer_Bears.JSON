  "modDescription": "This mod makes bears appear when screamers normally appear.\n\n## Details\n\n* Moves screamers in scout group to Zombie group, puts these bears in the scout group the screamers used to be in, so they should spawn when screamers spawned, but not scream.\n* Long story short: when screamers normally appear, bears appear. Bears do not scream. But screamers may just appear like normal zeds.\n\n## Changelog\n\nBugfixes\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Khelldons-Mods-a19/tree/main/Khelldon-ScreamerBears)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Khelldons-Mods-a18/tree/main/Khelldon-ScreamerBears)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Khelldon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/khelldon/), [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
