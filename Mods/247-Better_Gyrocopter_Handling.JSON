  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod added some tweaks to the Gyrocopter [vehicle](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/) settings to improve take offs and landing and give a lighter feel with better steering control, also slightly better 3rd person view added.\n\nThe gyrocopter will now be able to take off in a shorter distance.\n\n**Important:** If you are using another mod for vehicle speeds then this mod will throw a warning. If that is the case either comment out the gyrocopter settings in the other mod or comment them out in this mod.\n\nRagsy2145 found these settings optimal for his mod (velocityMax set at 18, 30) He recommend you keep these.\n\n**Info:** To comment out simply place at the end of the code.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\n<!-- <set xpath=\"/vehicles/vehicle[@name='vehicleGyrocopter']/property[@name='velocityMax']/@value\">18, 30</set> -->\n```\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/Ragsy2145/other-7-days-to-die-mods-and-modlets/-/archive/master/other-7-days-to-die-mods-and-modlets-master.zip?path=Ragsy_Better_Gyro_Handling)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11266-ragsy-s-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Ragsy2145](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ragsy2145/)",
