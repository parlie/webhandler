  "modDescription": "This adds the Ultimate Tool to your game. This is an 3 in 1 tool combing the Axe, Shovel and Pick Axe. AaronG85 has made this based on the original Entrenching Tool by robnunn10 and AaronG85 has his permission to continue the mod.\n\nHe has made this as a late game steel [tool](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/) but if people want lower version let him know and he will add them in.\n\nHeâ€™s using the Steel Axe as the mesh as he has no idea how to make custom meshes so if anyone wants to be helped that would be great.\n\n## Changelog\n\n**Version 1.1:** Thanks to Gouki for helping fix the console error and an error with the schematic.\n\n**[Download](https://apsnewcastle.com/AaronG85-UltimateTool.rar)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/28338-aarong85s-a20-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [AaronG85](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/aarong85/)",
