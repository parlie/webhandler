  "modDescription": "Have you ever found a weapon mod but wished you had the schematic for it instead? Well, now you can! Using the workbench, some paper, glue, and leather you can turn that mod into a schematic of the same type!\n\nOf course, in order to make the schematic, the original mod will be consumed in the process, but youâ€™ll have a shiny new schematic to read!\n\nSpecial Thanks to Steveburger (aka Khar Brons) for his help and ideas on this mod!\n\n## Changelog\n\nUpdated for A20.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-craftschematics)**\n\nIf you need help, you can use this [support link](https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/issues).\n\n**Credits:** [Donovan](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/donovan/)",
