  "modDescription": "Ever wondered, why you can’t spill full jars? Now you can do it with this 7 Days to Die mod. Simply scrap the full jar to an empty jar.

So here we go.\n\nCompatibility: **A18+**\n\n**[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1uhvq4rswgjxhuo/Claymore_Spill_Full_Jars.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
