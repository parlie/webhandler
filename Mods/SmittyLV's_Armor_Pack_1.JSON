I want to make every playthrough and experience different for each player.\n\n**New armor pieces are:**\n\n* Crusader Helmet / Curiass\n* Beserker Helmet / Curiass\n* Paladin Helmet / Curiass\n* Horned Helmet\n* Open Faced Silver Helmet\n* Elvish Helmet\n\nI am still working on adding more pieces from this armor bundle so stay tuned.\n\nALL ASSETS WERE PURCHASED AND LICENSED TO SMITTYLV.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HDITwjLSAncwKGxh2JHEPKvubKpeAt94/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [smittylv](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/smittylv/)",
