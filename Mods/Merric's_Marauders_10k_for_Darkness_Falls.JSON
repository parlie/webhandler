  "modDescription": "Here it is guys, Merric’s Marauders 10k for [Darkness Falls](https://7daystodiemods.com/darkness-falls-mod/). Very special thanks to Kamaka from the Merric Game Community for the map donation!\n\nRequires Darkness Fall 3.4, as well as Cpt Krunch’s mod, which includes the map, as well as extra prefabs that he has added specifically for this map.\n\nAll traders are present, water traders, 2 large quest areas, custom [prefabs](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-prefab/), and plenty of hand made places for you to explore!\n\n**Note:** If you experience any issues with player falling through [map](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/), this is NOT directly related to this map, and is a known bug in Darkness Falls itself. This is caused by the Cave Mod, and can be disabled without breaking save games.\n\nIf you experience this issue, please use the forum link or [DM](https://community.7daystodie.com/profile/61917-cpt-krunch/) him directly, and he can walk you through the fix, which is very easy and wont affect your saves.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TPzBZ9-3m9WR5921fIYOTldd-pLccqTp/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24237-captain-krunchs-custom-map-thread/).\n\n**Credits:** [Cpt Krunch](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/cpt-krunch/)",
