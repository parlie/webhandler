In Claymore’s case: Better in at least mod slots.\n\nThe default settings kidding us to only get 4 slots now for a level 6 tool/weapon. Seriously? This is not good. Took away the ability to craft level 6 things. Fine. No problem. Limiting the max amount of mods? Even for top tier things? No. With this 7 Days to Die mod, Level 6 thing = 6 mod [slots](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-more-slots/). Level 5 thing: 5 slots, and so on.
