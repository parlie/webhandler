  "modDescription": "This mod makes all PvP damage scaled to “1” when its day, which makes PvP in day not worthy and almost non existent. When its night, its purge time and everyone can start slaying each other with normal damage values. Does not effect anything else than playerdamage.\n\nWorks only serverside, only server download needed. Alpha 20 working.\n\n**Q:** Why scaled to 1, why not 0?. Its impossible to scale damage to 0 as 1 is default value.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/mipastu/nightpvp72d2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**\n\n**Credits:** [Mipastu](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/mipastu/)",
