  "modDescription": "This 7DTD mod adds the UMA Zombies from Bad Company A16 into the A18 game. None of these UMA Zombies were created by Doughphunghus, all credit for design goes to the various modders of Bad Company.\n\nThese zeds have been recoded by Khelldon to work with A17, because of that he has removed all special abilities the [Zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) once had. They now act exactly the same as all the vanilla zombies. Basically this is to add more variety into the game.\n\nDoughphunghus’s fork – updates:\n\n* Mod originally written for A17, updated for A18\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7d2dModlets/tree/master/Khelldon-BadCompanyUMAZeds)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Khelldon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/khelldon/), [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
