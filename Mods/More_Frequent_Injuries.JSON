  "modDescription": "Appenius always felt like the chances of getting injured are pretty low, this simple mod is trying to fix that by decreasing the resistances against these injuries effectively increasing the chances of getting injured.\n\nMod is made in a way that you can adjust the chances of each injury individually.\n\n**In this version settings are:**\n\n* Fatigued, Arm/Leg sprain, Laceration, Abrasion = 50% resistance reduction\n* Infection, Stun, Bleeding, Bleeding from barbed wire = unchanged\n\nYou will get infected a lot more often because of the injuries and you will bleed more often due to laceration injury.\n\n**Compatibility:**\n\nShould be compatible with every other mod, except the ones which change same values or add new injuries (it would require patch for these).\n\nFrom his testing it is compatible with mods which adds new zombies.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1pgirg2xR24OUpQ-0IyP7qS7NFnHuEcmz)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23227-more-frequent-injuries/).\n\n**Credits:** Appenius",
