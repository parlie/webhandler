  "modDescription": "Welcome to Resident Evil: Reimagined!\n\nHave you got what it takes to go back to where it all began? Enter the Survival Horror!\n\nThe Spencer Mansion Incident is a 7 Days to Die overhaul mod that plays a LOT more like Resident Evil than it does 7 Days to Die, with an end goal to aim for, escape.\n\n## Known Bug\n\nClicking ‘Equip’ on an item in your main inventory – You will get an infinite wall of red text, to stop it, move an item from your toolbelt or into your toolbelt. DO NOT ALT+F4 AS YOUR CHARACTER WILL RESET!\n\n## Setup\n\n* Requires vanilla A20.2 (b2) files.\n* When starting a new game, make sure to select the ‘Spencer Mansion Incident’ world.\n* FranticDan has made setup easy to follow by making the text orange for all settings you’ll need to manually change for the intended Resident Evil experience.\n* It will always be night, so be sure to change the Zombie Night Speed to your liking. (If your game is in day time, you’ll die a horrible death!)\n\n## Important\n\n**Please Note**\n\n1. The Spencer Mansion Incident is a Permadeath mod, and will test your combat and maneuverability skills.\n2. Multiplayer is now supported! So go have fun with a friend! (Huge thank you to wOOkienOOkie!)\n3. If you don’t change the orange coloured game settings to their stated value, you’ll be playing with unintended settings.\n4. Currently, Twitch Integration is not supported, but is planned.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Limited Inventory:** You’ll be restricted to a 6 slot toolbelt and 6 slots of main inventory.\n2. **Reworked and Rebalanced Skill Tree:** There are no attribute requirements for skills, so you’ll be free to put your skill points wherever you wish as long as you have enough points.\n3. You cannot jump.\n4. **Zombie Pain:** Zombies no longer feel pain, so they won’t even flinch when attacked.\n5. **Zombie Rage:** Disabled, zombies will never enter rage mode and get faster.\n6. **One Time Looting:** Almost every loot container can only be looted once, and will downgrade or destroy after closing.\n7. **Linked Storage:** You’ll be able to access your stored items from any of the storage boxes. (Huge thank you to wOOkie nOOkie!)\n8. **Simplified Criticals:** FranticDan has removed the severe critical injuries (Broken arm/leg etc) and shortened the duration of fatigue. You can still get lessor criticals, like sprains.\n\n## Weapons, Armour, Recovery Items and Hostiles\n\n### Weapons\n\n**Survival Knife**\n\n* Regular Attack: 12\n* Power Attack: 18\n* Block Damage: 20\n* Regular Stamina: 18\n* Power Stamina: 24\n* Attack Speed: 60/minute\n* Entity Range: 2 metres\n\n**Leather Knuckle Wraps (Toolbelt slots 7 8 9 0)**\n\n* Regular Attack: 6\n* Power Attack: 12\n* Block damage: 10\n* Regular Stamina: 12\n* Power Stamina: 18\n* Attack Speed: 80/minute\n* Entity Range: 2 metres\n\n**S.T.A.R.S Handgun**\n\n* Regular Damage: 36\n* HiPower Damage: 48\n* Magazine Size: 15 rounds\n* Firing Rate: 90/minute (150 with Samurai Edge Parts)\n* Reload Time: \\~3.5 seconds\n\n**Pump Shotgun**\n\n* Regular Damage: 12 x 10 pellets\n* HiPower Damage: 150\n* Tube Size: 6 rounds (10 with Assault Shotgun Parts)\n* Firing Rate: 45/minute (60 with Assault Shotgun Parts)\n* Reload Time: \\~3.6 seconds (\\~4.3 with Assault Shotgun Parts)\n\n**Rocket Launcher (Replaces the Grenade Launcher)**\n\n* Impact Damage: 1000\n* Reload Time: \\~3.7 seconds\n\n**Magnum Revolver**\n\n* Regular Damage: 150\n* HiPower Damage: 200\n* Cylinder Size: 6\n* Firing Rate: 60/minute\n* Reload Time: \\~5.8 seconds (4.6 with Speed Loader)\n\n**AK-47 Assault Rifle (Replaces the Flame Thrower)**\n\n* Regular Damage: 42\n* HiPower Damage: 56\n* Magazine Size: 30\n* Firing Rate: 300/minute\n* Reload Time: \\~5.2 seconds\n\n### Sub Weapons\n\n**Molotov Cocktail**\n\n* Damage: 25/second\n* Duration: 15 seconds\n\n**Makeshift Mine**\n\n* Central Damage: 160\n* Delay: 0.5 seconds\n\n**Grenade**\n\n* Central Damage: 341\n* Delay: 3 seconds\n\n### Armour\n\n**Padded**\n\n* Damage Resist: 5%\n* Mobility: 0%\n* Stamina: 0/s\n* Mod Slots: 1\n\n**Leather**\n\n* Damage Resist: 7%\n* Mobility: -2%\n* Stamina: -0.3/s\n* Mod Slots: 1\n\n**Scrap Iron**\n\n* Damage Resist: 9%\n* Mobility: -4%\n* Stamina: -0.6/s\n* Mod Slots: 2\n\n### Recovery Items\n\n**Green Herb**\n\n* Physician 0: 8 Health\n* Physician 1: 10 Health\n* Physician 2: 12 Health\n* Physician 3: 14 Health\n\n**Mixed Herb (Green + Green)**\n\n* Physician 0: 20 Health\n* Physician 1: 25 Health\n* Physician 2: 30 Health\n* Physician 3: 35 Health\n\n**Mixed Herb (Green + Green + Green)**\n\n* Physician 0: 36 Health\n* Physician 1: 45 Health\n* Physician 2: 54 Health\n* Physician 3: 63 Health\n\n**Mixed Herb (Green + Red)**\n\n* Physician 0: 36 Health\n* Physician 1: 45 Health\n* Physician 2: 54 Health\n* Physician 3: 63 Health\n\n**Blue Herb**\n\n* Physician 0: 4 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 1: 5 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 2: 6 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 3: 7 Health + Cures Poison\n\n**Mixed Herb (Green + Blue)**\n\n* Physician 0: 12 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 1: 15 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 2: 18 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 3: 21 Health + Cures Poison\n\n**Mixed Herb (Green + Green + Blue)**\n\n* Physician 0: 24 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 1: 30 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 2: 36 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 3: 42 Health + Cures Poison\n\n**Mixed Herb (Green + Red + Blue)**\n\n* Physician 0: 40 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 1: 50 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 2: 60 Health + Cures Poison\n* Physician 3: 70 Health + Cures Poison\n\n**First Aid Spray**\n\n* Physician 0: 120 Health\n* Physician 1: 150 Health\n* Physician 2: 180 Health\n* Physician 3: 210 Health\n\n### Hostiles (Spoiler warning!)\n\n**Zombie (Tier 1)**\n\n* Health: 200\n* Entity Damage: 8\n* Block Damage: 8\n* EXP: 400\n\n**Note 1:** Fast zombies can have their attacks miss if they are attacked just before they hit. **Note 2:** Slower zombies CAN NOT have their attacks interrupted.\n\n**Zombie (Tier 2)**\n\n* Health: 350\n* Entity Damage: 12\n* Block Damage: 12\n* EXP: 700\n\n**Zombie (Tier 3)**\n\n* Health: 450\n* Entity Damage: 16\n* Block Damage: 16\n* EXP: 900\n\n**Zombie (Tier 4)**\n\n* Health: 451\n* Entity Damage: 20\n* Block Damage: 20\n* EXP: 900\n\n**Zombie (Crippled)**\n\n* Health: 150\n* Entity Damage: 10\n* Block Damage: 12\n* EXP: 300\n\n**Cerberus**\n\n* Health: 200\n* Entity Damage: 8\n* Block Damage: 10\n* EXP: 400\n\n**Vulture**\n\n* Health: 18\n* Entity Damage: 7\n* Block Damage: 8\n* EXP: 400\n\n**Adder**\n\n* Health: 60\n* Entity Damage: 6\n* Block Damage: 4\n* EXP: 200\n\n**Web Spinner**\n\n* Health: 300\n* Entity Damage: 10\n* Block Damage: 10\n* EXP: 600\n\n**Crimson Head**\n\n* Health: 450\n* Entity Damage: 12\n* Block Damage: 50\n* EXP: 900\n\n**Hunter**\n\n* Health: 600\n* Entity Damage: 16\n* Block Damage: 40\n* EXP: 1200\n\n**Failed Test Subject**\n\n* Health: 500\n* Entity Damage: 20\n* Block Damage: 20\n* EXP: 1000\n\n## Planned Feature\n\n**Manual Saving:** Auto saving will be disabled and you’ll need to use an Ink Ribbon to save your progress.
