Also, as of 17.2, you can boost the XP multiplier within the game settings if you want this feature.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-levelfaster)**\n\nIf you find any issues or have a suggestion for improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/issues) and Donovan will look into it ASAP.\n\n**Credits:** [Donovan](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/donovan/)",
