  "modDescription": "Have you ever felt like the zombies in 7 Days to Die look too plain, clean, simple, weird and overall kind of boring? Then this great mod is for you!\n\nIt’s finally here, Xtrakicking’s zombie [texture](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-textures/) replacement mod that he has been working on for the past few weeks. This mod changes the appearance of almost every boring and simple-looking zombie out there. With this mod the [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) in the game will actually look like terrifying, gross and blood-thirsty walking corpses.\n\nYou’ll gasp as they approach you with their hands and mouths stained with blood from past victims, rotting and decaying flesh that’s ripped apart and shows their inner flesh and organs, big and devastating wounds that leave their bones out in the open and necrosis that will make the apocalypse more interesting.\n\nIf you want to see how the zombies look before installing it, you can check them out in [Xtrakicking’s blog](http://7daystodiezombietextureoverhaul.blogspot.com.es/2017/08/screamer-time.html).\n\nHere’s a list of all the zombies that have been changed or altered:\n\n## Festering Corpse\n\nHere is Festering Corpse zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Reanimated Corpse\n\nHere is Reanimated Corpse zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Infected Survivor\n\nHere is Infected Survivor zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Plagued Nurse\n\nHere is Plagued Nurse zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Putrid Girl\n\nHere is Putrid Girl zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Infected Mother\n\nHere is Infected Mother zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Departed Woman\n\nHere is Departed Woman zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Zombie Stripper\n\nHere is Zombie Stripper default texture and new texture:\n\n## Bloated Walker\n\nHere is Bloated Walker zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Zombie Biker\n\nHere is Zombie Biker default texture and new texture:\n\n## Screamer\n\nHere is Screamer zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Burn Victim\n\nHere is Burn Victim zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Radiated Feral Wight\n\nHere is Radiated Feral Wight zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Zombie Dog\n\nHere is Zombie Dog default texture and new texture:\n\n## Rotting Carcass\n\nHere is Rotting Carcass zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Cheerleader Zombie\n\nHere is Cheerleader Zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Businessman Zombie\n\nHere is Businessman Zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n## Fallen Soldier Zombie\n\nHere is Fallen Soldier Zombie default texture and new texture:\n\n**To Do Lists:**  \n\\-Move the mod over to xpath.  \n\\-Add multiple variants of each zombie once the mod moves to xpath.\n\n## Important Notice\n\nIt seems like the devs will be changing the design of zombies in A19\\. This means that either this mod will remain avaliable for A18.4 and previous versions only; that Xtrakicking will only update those with no design change if any, or that he will make a new and different version for A19 (or maybe a version that only adds more blood to the new upcoming zombies).\n\nEither way, A18.4 might be the last version of this mod featuring most of these zombie textures (unless an A18.5 comes out).\n\n## Changelog\n\n* New version for A18.4 avaliable. Enjoy! **_(new)_**\n* Updated for version 18.2!\n* New and improved Utility Worker zombie!\n\nInstalling instructions included in the readme.txt file.\n\n**[Download](https://mega.nz/#F!V75FkAQJ!FitWKrCYPkg2nhJ1e_MTWQ)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/4383-zombie-texture-replacement/).\n\n**Credits:** Xtrakicking  \n_Special Thanks:_ Derpopo, SphereII",
