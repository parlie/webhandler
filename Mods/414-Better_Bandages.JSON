  "modDescription": "This mod changes the way you craft first-aid bandages. Instead of requiring cloth and aloe, it now requires bandages and aloe.\n\nThis means that you can either craft normal bandages first out of cloth, and then make first-aid bandages or, more importantly, you can use any normal bandages you already have and/or find and turn them directly into first-aid bandages.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-betterbandages)**\n\nIf you find any issues or have a suggestion for improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/issues) and Donovan will look into it ASAP.\n\n**Credits:** [Donovan](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/donovan/)",
