  "modDescription": "This modlet makes it so [flashlights/lanterns](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-lights/) are a lot harder to obtain. Removes flashlights and flashlight related mods in loot and traders. Parts to create flashlights are found in loot/traders but should not be common.\n\n**Adds new items (recolors of existing items) that can be found or bought from trader:**\n\n* Flashlight Case: An empty flashlight case. Can still melee with it.\n* Small Bulb: Small Halogen bulb, used for crafting flashlights.\n* NevRDie Cell: Small C Cell for flashlights and lanterns.\n\n**Modifies these recipes, to require different ingredients:**\n\n* The melee flashlight\n* The placeable lantern\n\n**Adds new recipes:**\n\n* Can make a car battery out of many NevRDie Cells.\n* Can scrap a working flashlight for NevRDie Cells.\n\n**Details:**\n\n* Why? Because flashlights/placeable lantern are too OP/bright and he like a darker game. If brightness could be adjusted he would have made them easier to craft, but hard to craft a quality, bright one. This will force you to use torches (heat sources) and/or have a harder time looting (for awhile) vs turning on your headlight all day/night.\n* The new parts are not common in loot, so it should take a little while to get all the parts and craft, and by that time you should relish the fact you have anything related to a flashlight mod in your helmet/gun. This also means those who loot a lot will be rewarded sooner.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **v1.0.2:** Rebalanced to make it much harder to obtain parts.\n* **v1.0.1:** Made new items harder to find. Adjusted recipes using new items to be harder.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a19/tree/main/Doughs-Nerf-FlashlightsAndLanterns)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
