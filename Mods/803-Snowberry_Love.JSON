  "modDescription": "In the vanilla game, snowberries are nearly usesless. They cannot be grown, their only use is to eat them, and they don’t give much [food](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/).\n\nThis seems like a waste to him, so he added a bunch of uses for snowberries.\n\n## Features\n\nIn the real world, snowberries were used mostly for [medicinal](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-medical-supplies/) purposes by Native American tribes.\n\nThey also taste like wintergreen (reportedly – he has not eaten them). He based the in-game uses on these facts.\\*\n\n* Snowberries can be grown from [seeds](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-farming/) and harvested. The seed recipe is unlocked from either a schematic, or from the same Living Off The Land perk level as blueberry seeds.\n* Snowberry tea can be crafted in a campfire with a cooking pot. The [tea](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-drinks/) gives 24 water and cures dysentery 10%. Snowberry paste can be used the same as medical aloe cream, and can be used instead of aloe cream when crafting first aid bandages. The paste takes five snowberries to craft.\n* Snowberries replace blueberries in herbal antibiotics recipes.\n* Grandma’s Gin: “How intelligent people get drunk and belligerent.” It provides the buffs of beer and the nerdy glasses, combined. The gin recipe is unlocked from either a schematic, or from the same Master Chef perk level as Grandpa’s Moonshine.\n\n**\\*References:**\n\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphoricarpos#Cultivation_&_Medicinal_Uses)\n* USDA [Plant of the Week: Creeping Snowberry](https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/plant-of-the-week/gaultheria_hispidula.shtml)\n* USDA [Snowberry Plant Fact Sheet](https://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_syal.pdf) (PDF)\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **v1.0.1: Snowberries now stay planted when harvested**  \n   * Snowberries now grow into HarvestPlayer version (not version in POIs)  \n   * Updated patch version\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThis mod uses XPath to modify XML files, and does not require SDX or DMT.
