  "modDescription": "This mod adds 3 new types of coal sacks to the 7 Days to Die. Building big is fancy, but also a pain in the back. Reason: Calculating burn times. Especially for the forge. To make it short:\n\n* Added 3 types of coal sacks: 10, 30 & 60 minute different burn time.\n* Craftable in the workbench. Coal needed: 10, 30 & 60\\. Claymore know: Simple math is simple.\n* Raised the general burn time of one coal to 60 seconds to make it finally better than wood, and give it a well known use â€“ even for a single piece. This makes it 3 times better than one wood.\n\nCompatibility: **A18+**\n\n**Changes:**  \n1.0.1: Small typo prevented to get the alternation of one piece of coal not applied. Fixed.\n\n**[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/uyy7cung8is87pc/Claymore_Sack_Coal.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
