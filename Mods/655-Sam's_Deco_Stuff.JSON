  "modDescription": "For the house-flippers, the base-builders, the flib-gibbers and other weirdos, here are a bunch of blocks you can use to make your bunker a nice warm home. This is a server-side mod so it only uses existing blocks; it just makes them accessible outside of the creative menu.\n\nMost of the blocks are divided up into a few recipes that give a shape variant block, so you can use the same materials and make a bunch of different items. There are a handful of special items that felt like they needed to be kept separate. Just search ‘deco’ in the workbench crafting menu and you’ll be well on your way.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14boBZlT8ifjy9u00xxOWRPjSsQNVrhPl)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23380-sams-deco-stuff/).\n\n**Credits:** [Saminal](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/saminal/)",
