For each book you read, you are provided 2 [skill points](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-skill-points/) for increasing your knowledge of the world and game, and that specific Encyclopedia volume is added to your Journal in case you want to read back through it later.\n\nThe Encyclopedia contains over 80 entries and are compiled by actual players via a crowd-source Google shared document. The author of each entry is attributed in the content displayed to the player in-game.\n\n## Volumes\n\n* Blood Moon Horde Night\n* Building Materials\n* Clothing and Armor\n* Education and XP Gain\n* Electronics\n* Existing Structure Bases (Above-Ground)\n* Farming and Foods\n* Harvesting Resources\n* Inventory Management\n* Maximizing Loot\n* Traps\n* Underground Bases\n* Vehicles\n* Weapons\n* Zombies\n\nThis mod was tested on: A19.3 (b3)\n\n## Changelog\n\n**v1.0a:** Bugfix release published.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n* Extract the zip file\n* Copy the folder “Zombiepedia\\_Skillpoints” into your Mods folder\n* If you don’t have a Mods folder & are playing on Steam under Windows:  \n   * Right-click the game in Steam and select Properties  \n   * Click the “Local Files” tab  \n   * Click the “Browse Local Files” button  \n   * In the popup that appears, create a folder called “Mods”  \n         * By default this path would end up being: c:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\7 Days To Die\\\\Mods\n\nThis XML-only XPath mod is compatible with both Singleplayer and Dedicated Server play and only needs to be installed onto the server.
