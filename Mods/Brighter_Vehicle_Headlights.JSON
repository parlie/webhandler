Also this version adds [Manux Custom Vehicles](https://7daystodiemods.com/manuxs-custom-vehicles-mod/) and Guppycur’s Vehicle Madness support, along with normal vanilla vehicles.\n\n**Important Note:** If you want to include any of his vehicle mods or other mods in a ‘mod overhaul’ please do him the courtesy of asking for permission first… when given you must give the due credit to himself and any other modders that may be credited under the “Credits & Additional Credits” sections if any. Also you are not allowed to extract any unity files without his permission either, if there has been an alpha change then wait and files will be updated for the new alpha version as soon as he possibly can.
