  "modDescription": "Hello folks, this is my first mod upload to this site. Inside this mod, I tweak a few things around, like [farming](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-farming/) and food, as well as a few other things, like perk buffs that feel more rewarding to actually buy them. For example, seeds now drop from farm plots guaranteed, and [food](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/) no longer requires oddly high amounts of certain ingredients just to craft them. Gone is the days you need 5 pieces of meat just to craft a single piece of boiled meat! That is one of the many tweaks made to make your survival a bit better and less, well, strange! I genuinely hope you folks enjoy, I hope this mod comes of great service to you lot!\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jvWlKk-qT6-vrU1VuBy-ihifT8dEiy-A/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [Leviathan\\_0ne](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/leviathan_0ne/)",
