  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod adds a tiny chance to harvest rotting flesh and bones, if you dig dirt, snow, sand, etc. (“soft” terrain).\n\nClaymore is no grinder. He know, there are enough corpses on the streets to harvest. Even vultures and [zombie](https://7daystodiemods.com/zombie-mods/) dogs are giving some rotting flesh and bones. But his thought was: It’s an apocalypse. 7 billion humans and at least the same amount of animals died long time ago. So we should find some leftovers of them, if we’re digging around.\n\nCompatibility: A18+\n\n[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/be3ply9yz4yl2p1/Claymore_Resourceful_Top_Terrain.zip)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
