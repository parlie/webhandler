  "modDescription": "This 7DTD mod adds variants of each powered [door](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-doors/) where the power state is inverted. For example, by default the drawbridge is down when powered. The inverted variant is up when powered.\n\n**Inverted doors added:**\n\n* Reinforced Drawbridge\n* Vault Door 03\n* Vault Hatch v3\n* Steel Garage Door 3×2\n* Steel Garage Door 5×3\n\nRecipes for each are equivalent to the normal variants. The Powered Doors and Bridges Schematic will unlock all inverse variants. Level 4 – Inventor of the Advanced Engineering perk will unlock all inverse variants. This is a DMT mod. So requires [DMT Modding Tool](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/13037-dmt-modding-tool/).\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/tbeswick96/7dtd-mods/releases/download/1.0.0/Tims_InverseDoors.zip)**\n\nIf you have any problems, you can use this [support link](https://github.com/tbeswick96/7dtd-mods/issues).\n\n**Credits:** Timbeswick",
