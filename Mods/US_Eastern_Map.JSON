  "modDescription": "My first custom [map](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/) created to play with my friend on a dedicated server. It was my first time taking the game to a server since started playing in 2020, so it’s not extremely accurate.\n\nI scaled the map wrong in [KingGen](https://7daystodiemods.com/kinggen/) so 90% of NYC was blown off by a plate-tectonics of KingGen’s renderer. I also mismatched height-map with elevation scale used by KingGen so sea level was raised to put coastal areas under water.\n\nI used U.S. topographic map downloaded from USGS.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CQ4Yv_qGk9tO0K7G8eTP_9r2dH276EzZ/view?usp=sharing)** Google Drive File  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16dQ51hGiJqFEHoQh9UpW1jxFLABJe1b4?usp=sharing)** Google Drive Folder\n\n**Credits:** VA1090528KO",
