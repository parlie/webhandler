  "modShortDescription": "Do you also never use the vanilla in-game electric lights due to either extreme brightness? Or because they only come with super cold light temperatures?",
  "modDescription": "Do you also never use the vanilla in-game [electric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-electricity/) lights due to either extreme brightness? Or because they only come with super cold light temperatures? Than ocbMaurice has a solution for you.\n\nAnother standalone excerpt from his bigger [electricity overhaul mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/electricity-overhaul-mod/).\n\nLamps that can individually be configured in-game to be dimmed down or to have another color temperature (or pick any other color). For spotlights you can also configure the emitted light cone angle.\n\nIt should work either with his overhaul mod or standalone and should also support multiplayer (server and all clients need the mod installed).\n\nBlocks are behind engineering perk level 2 or behind “Basics of Electricity Schematic” (Generator Bank Schematics). Power consumption varies between 2 and 3 Watts per Tick. Note that only lamps within your claim block can be configured! Also note that too many [lights](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-lights/) can easily strain your GPU. Hope the images are convincing enough.\n\n**Note:** The switch on the left side is a teaser for another mod for push button circuits (press any button in the room to toggle the lights). Wires are hidden via his [no-wires mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/dmt-mod-to-hide-wires-when-wiring-tool-is-not-equipped/).\n\nHe guess a few have tried to accomplish this, but so far he didn’t see any other mod that goes this far. In order to support this nicely he had to create a completely new Block and TileEntity class (He has used ID 244). This in turn makes it very simple now to add new lights based on the new block and recipes XML (see [GitHub page](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/ElectricityLamps) for further info).\n\n## Changelog\n\n**Version 0.5.1**\n\nAdded LightOrientation option to realign spotlights. Finally was able to switch the ceiling fan light to use a spotlight that properly points down (looks much better).\n\nHe has developed and tested this mod against version a19.6b8.\n\nThis is a DMT mod. So requires [DMT Modding Tool](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/13037-dmt-modding-tool/).\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/OCB7D2D/ElectricityLamps/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/25582-new-and-better-electric-lamplight-blocks-dmtharmony/).\n\n**Credits:** [ocbMaurice](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ocbmaurice/)",
