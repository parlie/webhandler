  "modDescription": "## Introduction\n\nThe Oakraven Forest Collection offers an experimental ‘pick and mix’ bundle of Quality of Life mods to enhance your 7D2D experience. It is brought to you by oakraven and arramus. These mods will be regularly updated based on feedback, and the number of mods will continue to increase as they move from development stage to experimental release, and then to stable.\n\nThey can be added as standalone individual mods, or combined to cover many aspects of game-play. Since these mods contain custom content, they must be installed in your ‘Mods’ folder on both the server and within player game files.\n\n### Chicken Coops\n\nThese custom Chicken Coops allow players to raise [chickens](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-animals/) for eggs, feathers, and grown chickens to place as ‘pets’ or to ‘harvest’. Chicks can be found in birds’ nests and then placed in the Coops. It requires 2 chicks to activate each Coop.\n\n### Bee Hives\n\nThese custom Bee Hives allow players to raise bees to produce [honey](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/).\n\n### Custom Work Stations\n\nCustom Work Stations for 7D2D. These Work Stations provide players with a new forge, chemistry table/station, and a powder mixer to assist with making concrete. They have their own particles and animation effects and will bring variety to a player’s work shop. These Work Stations can be unlocked as with default items of the same type.\n\n### Hydroponic Underground Farming\n\nThis mod allows players to add hydroponic ‘underground’ farm plots that use artificial lighting to help the plants grow. Comes with a Work Bench and other features for successful hydroponic [farming](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-farming/). Underground Farming features are unlocked from ‘Living off the Land – Skill 2’. Custom recipes for the custom vegetables and fruit will continue to be added.\n\n### Cooking Stations\n\nThis mod adds custom Cooking Stations such as mixers, blenders, a mincing machine, and oven type appliances. Mixers, blenders, and the mincing machine unlock at Master Chef Skill 1\\. The oven type appliances unlock at Master Chef Skill 2.\n\n### Oak Dragon UI\n\nThis provides players with a custom User Interface with a Dragon theme. In addition to the overall main layout, a few custom icons will also be noticeable.\n\n### Torches and Lights\n\nThis mod provides players with a variety of Torches and [Lights](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-lights/) for hanging and standing. They can be crafted on the Workbench and are fueled by wood.\n\n### Power Things\n\nA custom assortment of Solar, [Generator](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-electricity/), Battery, and Cell solutions for all of your power needs. A prerequisite to manufacturing cells is to find their crystals in the Burnt Forest and Wasteland.\n\n### Drawbridges (Walkways)\n\nThe Drawbridges Mod allows players to add 4 varieties of Walkway in a 1 x 4 (1 block wide and extends additional 4 blocks from base block), 3 x 4 format (3 blocks wide and extends additional 4 blocks from base block) and comparable 1 x 8/3 x 8 formats.\n\n### Water Wells and Standpipe\n\nThis mod allows players to craft custom water wells, water standpipes, and sinks on the Workbench. Players can fill up their glass jars and buckets with [water](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-drinks/) from these water sources. The sinks also provide players with very generous storage capacity.\n\n### Sign Cupboards for Writable Storage\n\nGives players additional custom writable [storage](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-storage/) containers for storing belongings. Choosing a container type is performed through a Variant Helper in the same way we can choose from a selection of construction blocks.\n\n### Rock Drill\n\nThe Oakraven Rock Drill allows players to extract [mining](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-mining/) resources from the ground. The resources collected provide a mixture of definite and random resources in variable amounts. The Oakraven Rock Drill is powered with specific Rock Drill Gas that is produced using shale on the chemistry table.\n\n### Fish Farm\n\nThe Oakraven Fish Farm mod allows players to farm fish through all stages of development. The process for farming is as follows – Create your Fish Farm, place it on the ground, add Fish Growing Kit, and wait as the fish go through an incubation, hatching, growth and breeding stage, and finally collected. Once collected, the [fish](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-fishing/) can be placed on the ground and harvest for fillets (3 kinds of unique fillets). Alternatively, you can craft a Fish Stick and cook a ‘Fish on a Stick’ snack. The Fish Stick can also be used as a melee weapon. Oakraven Fish are cooked on a stand alone Fish Oven.\n\nWickidaurazgaming kindly shared a showcase of some of the mods in action. Some will be updated with additional features and fixes in time but will remain true to the concept shared in this showcase.\n\n**Introduction to:** Chicken Coops, Bee Hives, Custom Work Stations, Power Things, Sign Cupboards for Writable Storage, Torches and Lights, Cooking Stations, Hydroponic Underground Farming, Water Wells and Standpipe, Drawbridges (Walkways)\n\n**Introduction to:** Oakraven Forest – Dragon UI, Rock Drill, Fish Farm\n\n## Detailed Installation Instructions\n\nFor Server Admin/Hosts and Players who have never installed a 7D2D mod before, here are some simple step by step instructions.\n\n1. If you’ve never installed a mod before, it is necessary to create a ‘Mods’ folder in the main directory (typically: **\\\\SteamLibrary\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\7 Days To Die**). If you have a custom install or your server host has modified the installation location, then you may have to explore.\n2. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature) in your ‘7 Days To Die’ main directory folder.\n3. You can now drag the mod or collection of mod folder(s) directly out of the zipped file and it can be placed into the Mods folder.\n* Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES\n* Do players also need to install this Mod? = YES\n\nIf players do not install the same mods as the Server/Host, they will not be able to join.\n\n## Changelog\n\n**Updated Hydroponic Farming**\n\nAdded description to items found on Wild Plants to show where and when they can be found.\n\n**Updated Cooking Stations**\n\nNew icons ^^\n\n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228180)** Chicken Coops  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228179)** Bee Hives  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228172)** Custom Work Stations  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228174)** Hydroponic Underground Farming  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228185)** Cooking Stations  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228214)** Oak Dragon UI  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228257)** Torches and Lights  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228209)** Power Things  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/228903)** Drawbridges (Walkways)  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/229232)** Water Wells and Standpipe  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/229355)** Sign Cupboards for Writable Storage  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/230598)** Rock Drill  \n**[Download](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/230930)** Fish Farm\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/27806-a20-oakraven-forest-collection/).\n\n**Credits:** [Arramus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/arramus/), Oakraven",
