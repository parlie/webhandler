  "modDescription": "This mod add 20 different models with different texture variations that create 149 unique [hats](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-clothing/). They work as cosmetic mods (same slot as the dyes) and are applicable on any head gear. They are only found in loot (same group as the hats) so they are pretty rare.\n\nThe models are fitted to a head size of 0.5, so extreme sizes may look wrong.\n\nModels ripped from The Sims 4.\n\n## Changelog\n\n**1.01:** Removed ability to install on apparels. Now the mods are limited to armor.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/Snufki-n/Snufkin_Modlets_A19/raw/master/Snufkin_HatMadness.rar)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21060-snufkins-hat-madness/).\n\n**Credits:** [Snufkin](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/snufkin/)",
