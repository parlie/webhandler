  "modDescription": "This mod adds scrap iron and steel bars. Upgrade path= Wood>Scrap Iron>Iron>Steel. There is no downgrade path for them, so if they run out of hit points they will break and not turn back into the lower one like a lot of blocks do. Hit points are 300>1000>2500>6000.\n\n**[Download](http://cdgroup.org/files/7dtd/ScrapIronandSteelBars.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/8777-lucs-modlet-collection-quality-bonuses-better-stamina-terrain-mv-spd-etc/).\n\n**Credits:** [Luc](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/luc/)",
