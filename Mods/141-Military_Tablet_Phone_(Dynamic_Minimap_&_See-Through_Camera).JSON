  "modDescription": "Here’s Moongaming’s latest mod that adds a Military Tablet and a phone to the game. (Can be crafted in a workbench under science)\n\nThe tablet/phone will display the map right in the palm of your hand, you can zoom in/out with left click.\n\nAlso includes a see-through camera that you can toggle with right click to see through walls when close, and a flashlight for the phone.\n\nThe tablet/phone will mark every zombies with a red arrows, animals with a paw icon, other players with a green arrow, and a yellow icon for traders.\n\nThe map is also pretty FPS hungry when being used, so for an optimal performance you’ll need decent FPS (> 60)  \nDisabling vsync can help with reducing performance impact.\n\n**Important:** You need to disable Occlusion (main menu only) and enable Shadows (nearest is enough) in the graphics setting if you want the map to display correctly, might make another one that don’t need it later.\n\n[Download](https://gitlab.com/oignonchaud/oignonchaud-7d2d-mods-a18/-/archive/master/oignonchaud-7d2d-mods-a18-master.zip?path=MilitaryTablet)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/16061-military-tablet-dynamic-minimap-see-through-camera/).\n\n**Credits:** [Moongaming](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/moongaming/)",
