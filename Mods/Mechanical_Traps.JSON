It includes Bear Trap, Fire Trap, Pierce Trap, Acid Trap and the classic Spike Trap. Version 3 adds Proximity Mine, Claymore and remote-controlled C4.\n\nYou can craft them in the Workbench using basic resources. You can also pick up every traps as long as you repaired them with the hammer before.\n\nThis is still a work-in-progress and some of the traps (like the piercing one) can be buggy.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/oignonchaud/oignonchaud-7d2d-mods-a18/-/archive/master/oignonchaud-7d2d-mods-a18-master.zip?path=Traps+and+stuff)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/14215-mechanical-traps-bear-trap-spike-trap-fire-trap-etc/).\n\n**Credits:** [Moongaming](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/moongaming/)  \n_Special Thanks:_ Haidrgna, Mdf25",
