  "modDescription": "The hind is back for A20!\n\n## Version 2\n\n1. Updated to A20 XML\n2. Reworked the Helicopter physics\n3. New unity file has compressed textures and other changes.\n4. Has fixed seats 5\n5. [Vehicle](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/) mods are vfuel, vengine and vlight (no Cosmetic mod)\n6. Added smoke particles\n7. Helicopter placing improved\n8. Reduced size a bit as it is a game after all.\n\nThis version has an alternate vehicle file for those that like the older style heli controls himself and Bdub came up with for the [MD 500](https://7daystodiemods.com/md-500/) way back… Just simply rename existing vehicles.xml to oldvehicles.xml and rename the one called RagsnBdubstyleoldvehicles.xml to vehicles.xml.\n\n**Important Note:** If you want to include any of his vehicle mods or other mods in a ‘mod overhaul’ please do him the courtesy of asking for permission first… when given you must give the due credit to himself and any other modders that may be credited under the “Credits & Additional Credits” sections if any. Also you are not allowed to extract any unity files without his permission either, if there has been an alpha change then wait and files will be updated for the new alpha version as soon as he possibly can.
