  "modDescription": "The maximum character level is increased from 300 to 500\\. All attributes have been increased from 10 to 13 levels, and most [perks](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-perks/) have been given 1 to 3 new levels with fun and powerful new bonuses. Run faster, hit harder, be stealthier, and learn new recipes.\n\n**WARNING:** The High Level Perks mod is experimental and unbalanced. It is merely for purposes of pushing the limits of what could be done in the game. Dhlmaster cannot at this time recommend it for anyone trying to run a serious game. He is collecting a lot of feedback and will be trying to develop a better version of the mod sometime after alpha 20 is released. He apologize for not making this more clear when he initially published the mod.\n\nThis mod works on servers with no client side installation necessary, or on single player games.\n\n**[Download](https://imadeyoursite.com/7days/BModHighLevelPerks.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24958-brians-mods-for-alpha-196/).\n\n**Credits:** [Dhlmaster](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/dhlmaster/)",
