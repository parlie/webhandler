  "modDescription": "This mod adds a writing desk to the game, where you can craft schematics and books out of blueprints. You get blueprints by scraping books and schematics you already know.\n\nThe writing desk will be unlocked by intellect 8, so its more for endgame to create [books](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-books/) you cant find.\n\nTranslation for English and German included.\n\nWritten for A19.2, but should also work for all A18 and A19 versions.\n\n**[Download](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsAFcUo-08lq8GyTWjUsOTXTacsQ?e=e5wJ6n)**\n\n**Credits:** Morlon",
