  "modDescription": "This mod brings back the stainless steel polish to the 7 Days to Die. Upgrade the blocks to stainless steel and enjoy them just like old times.\n\n**Fully ported to A18:**\n\n* You have to learn the schematic or the perk Yeah Science! level 4.\n* The schematics are a rare find. Either from high level [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/zombie-mods/) or bookshelves.\n* Polished steel blocks now have a high explosion resistance. Reason: Demolition zombie.\n* Nothing changed, how many polish you need to upgrade from steel blocks: Same as A16.\n* Polish can be found in various [loot](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-loot/) containers: Not that often, but fitting amounts. Also it can be bought by traders, like we had in the past. Just the polish – not the recipe!\n* Fully translated back, like it was in A16.\n* To upgrade, you need to use either a clawhammer or nailgun. Stone axes won’t work\n\n**Changelog**\n\n* 2.0.1: Removed “progression.xml”, since it’s a leftover from his [snowberry seeds](https://7daystodiemods.com/snowberry-seeds/) mod. No need to redownload, because it simply has no function. **_(new)_**\n* 2.0.0: The Pimps again changed something, so the regular method of using the masterblock isn’t working anymore. Workaround: Append the upgrade to each block itself.\n\n**[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/7ql8lhnuc87cvb9/Claymore_Stainless_Steel_Returns.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
