  "modShortDescription": "This mod allows Demolishers to spawn in the Wasteland during the daytime and at nighttime.",
  "modDescription": "This mod allows Demolishers to spawn in the Wasteland during the daytime and at nighttime. The Demolisher has simply been added to the requisite zombie group for that location and will spawn within standard probability parameters. However, in real play testing, being placed at the top of the group list seems to give the Demolisher a higher probability of spawning first or very early into the spawn cycle.\n\nArramus is relatively new to 7D2D and missed out on Snufkin’s Zombies as they appear to need a bit of tweaking for the latest build. However, he did play on a server where the Demolisher was roaming quite freely in the Wasteland and Forest (possibly just walked out of the Wasteland) and he wanted to play it again.\n\nThat mod was probably made by War3zuk as Arramus did see it on a mod site but it had been pulled for incompatibility issues with an update. Arramus couldn’t find any others around the community similar to this and he is attempting to emulate it because it was a lot of fun. As such, credit for the inspiration must certainly be directed at War3zuk unless Arramus missed other builds; apologies if that’s the case.\n\nArramus did however build this the hard way through trial and error and going through the xml files. He is glad he did as there was a reference to a wasteland group of [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) appearing with the Screamer and an earlier build he tested would have seen a Demolisher visiting someone’s front door when it is least expected. Giving the Demolishers a unique group solved that issue.\n\nAs with the standard settings, spawns of any zombie in the Wasteland during the daytime is infrequent while nighttime can become a real challenge if you stick around long enough. Allowing Demolishers to spawn at any time just adds to the challenge.\n\nDaytime – Nice and Sedate\n\nNighttime\n\nNighttime Extreme\n\n```\n<configs>\n\n\t<set xpath=\"/spawning\">\n\n\t<biome name=\"wasteland\">\n\t\t<spawn maxcount=\"1\" respawndelay=\"0.3\" time=\"Day\"\tentitygroup=\"ZombiesWastelandDayDemolition\" />\n\t\t<spawn maxcount=\"3\" respawndelay=\"0\" time=\"Night\" entitygroup=\"ZombiesWastelandNightDemolition\" />\n\t\t<spawn maxcount=\"1\" respawndelay=\"0.3\" time=\"Any\" entitygroup=\"EnemyAnimalsWasteland\" spawnDeadChance=\"0\" />\n\t</biome>\n\n\t</set>\n\t\n</configs>\n```\n\n```\n<configs>\n\n\t<append xpath=\"/entitygroups\">\n\t\n\t\t<!-- Based on \"ZombiesAll\" as per current wasteland day setting - Gives more variety with recent additions -->\n\t\n\t\t<entitygroup name=\"ZombiesWastelandDayDemolition\">\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieDemolition\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieBoe\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieJoe\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieSteve\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieMoe\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieYo\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieBusinessMan\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieArlene\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieDarlene\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieMarlene\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieSkateboarder\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieCheerleader\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieOldTimer\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieBiker\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieFarmer\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieStripper\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieUtilityWorker\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieJanitor\" prob=\"0.2\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieNurse\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieSteveCrawler\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieFatHawaiian\" prob=\"0.3\"/>\n\t\t</entitygroup>\n\t\t\n\t\t<!-- Based on \"ZombiesWastelandNight\" as per current wasteland night setting -->\n\t\t\n\t\t<entitygroup name=\"ZombiesWastelandNightDemolition\">\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieDemolition\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieSpiderFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieBoeFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieJoeFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieSteveFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieMoeFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieYoFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieBusinessManFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieArleneFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieDarleneFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieMarleneFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieNurseFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"animalZombieDog\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieSteveCrawlerFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieFatCopFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieBurnt\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"animalZombieBear\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieWightFeral\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"animalZombieVulture\" prob=\"0.6\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"animalZombieVultureRadiated\"  prob=\"0.4\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieMaleHazmat\" prob=\"0.2\"/>\n\t\t<entity name=\"zombieFatHawaiian\"/>\n\t\t</entitygroup>\n\t\t\n\t </append>\n\t \n</configs>\n```\n\n## Installation – For players and server hosts who have never installed a mod before\n\nIf you’ve never installed a mod before it is necessary to create a mod folder in the main directory or in an area suggested by your server host if they have modified the installation. Simply make a new folder called **Mods** (with a capital **M** to reflect standard nomenclature). If you drag the mod folder directly out of the zipped file it can be placed directly into the **Mods** folder and the game will look in there as you launch your World. If you allow your unzip function to extract the folder, it may make another unnecessary folder and place the mod inside it. This will not be recognised by the game/server if you place it in the **Mods** folder like this. Please take it out of the extra folder level. The top layer will be a single folder and in the second layer you will see a **ModInfo.xml** folder with or without additional folders depending on the mod. This will become elementary once you’ve launched a few mods.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/arramus/Demolisher-Spawner/archive/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21800-day-and-night-wasteland-demolisher/).\n\n**Credits:** [Arramus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/arramus/)",
