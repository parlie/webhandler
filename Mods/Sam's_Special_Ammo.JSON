  "modDescription": "A little server-side mod that adds a few extra tactical ammo types:\n\n* A concussion grenade, which knocks down enemies but does low damage\n* A shock grenade, which electrifies everybody in a 6 metre radius\n* Shock [arrows](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-ammo/) and bolts, which act like a taser – shocking and knocking down any enemy they hit\n* A heavy snowball – a little more effective than the basic snowball, since it’s got a rock in the middle of it\n\nThe grenades are gated behind Demolitions Expert, or by finding the schematics, and the arrows can be unlocked by completing the Ranger book series, or progressing in Advanced Engineering.\n\nAnybody can stick a rock in a snowball.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **_(new)_** Fixed a bug with the shock arrows and bolts that would sometimes cause the shock buff to apply to the player instead of the target, when sneaking. Weird.\n* Bugfix – Shock Bolts weren’t available as an ammo type for the Iron Crossbow. They are now.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C0AITOcFfUmXDd-09B_-sJbxAl1SE3-w/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23733-sams-special-ammo/).\n\n**Credits:** [Saminal](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/saminal/)",
