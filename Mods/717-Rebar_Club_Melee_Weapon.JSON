  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod adds another heavy melee weapon, inspired by Fallout. Higher damage/range than the sledgehammer, but higher stamina costs. Has a heavy attack with high stamina consumption that gives a 50% chance to dismember and a 50% chance to deliver an AOE knockdown like the Heavy Metal perk gives. Supports the same [weapon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) mods as the sledgehammer. Crafted at the workbench.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/bdubyah/Mods---A18/-/archive/master/Mods---A18-master.zip?path=Rebar%20Club)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11875-bdubyahs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Bdubyah](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/bdubyah/)",
