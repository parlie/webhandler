  "modDescription": "Simple modlet that allows crafting of level 6 devices. It works for tools, [weapons](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) and armour. The armour is a bit weird because you jump from level 4 straight to level 6 because there is no fifth skill level of those perks. It works, but maybe not optimally. Maybe in the future I will expand this to add a fifth level to the armour perks so that it can scale a bit more smoothly. For now it works and I’m not going to sweat it.\n\nOh, the reason I wrote this is because it was ticking me off that my level 100+ character still hadn’t found a level 6 sniper rifle yet. Not cool.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lRVb7hYxNYqCHLehzrouEHXzOlIzoz7r/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [ModMangler](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/modmangler/), Flexible Games (modding video)",
