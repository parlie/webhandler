  "modDescription": "Dead simple modlet that increased the number of mod slots of an item to match the item level. Level 5 shotgun? 5 mod slots. That kind of thing.\n\n**NOTE!** This only affects NEWLY ACQUIRED items. Find a new [shotgun](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/)? It will have a right number of mod slots. Have one in a box? It will have the OLD number of mod slots. Buy one from a trader before a re-stock? Old number.\n\nAs long as you find, or craft a new item after installing this mod it will have the increased number of [slots](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-more-slots/). If you start a new game with the mod installed then of course you wonâ€™t have to worry about it because every item will be created after the mod was active.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cqiBnR1Z1pqfNgmIsdM_p0AFPxJhmMjn/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [ModMangler](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/modmangler/) and all of the brave modders before me. ðŸ™‚",
