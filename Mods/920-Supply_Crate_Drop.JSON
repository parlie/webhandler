  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod adds lootable supply crates to the world.\n\nWhen the zombie apocalypse started most feared them and tried to kill them. The army was overrun and most of society had been bit or died and turned.\n\nThe few remaining some were on the zombies side and wanted to help them, so they dropped supply crates with items to help the zombies defend themselves. These people became known as the P.A.K.Z (People Against Killing Zombies)\n\nHowever they being stupid didn’t realise these zombies were as brain dead as they were and wandered past them as if they didnt exist. Thats where you get to benefit from the P.A.K.Z stupidity as littered across the world these supply crates remain untouched for you to collect.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* Reduced spawning on Asphalt and Roads\n* May vary from game to game.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/stallionsden/stallionsmodlets/tree/main/Stallionsdens%20Supply%20Crates)**\n\nIf you appreciate Stallionsden’s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](http://paypal.me/AnthonyCar78).\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19911-stallionsdens-and-valmars-a19-mod-thread/).\n\n**Credits:** [Stallionsden](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/stallionsden/), Various",
