  "modDescription": "This mod adds 2 extra damaging steel [grenades](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-ammo/) (1 regular timed grenade, the other a contact grenade). These grenades can be very dangerous to use and cause block damage and destruction (earth -> wood -> stone -> metal, in that order of destructive potential), unlike vanilla grenades. These are not as powerful as TNT.\n\nThe new items can be crafted or bought from traders.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a19/tree/main/Doughs-Buff-Grenades)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
