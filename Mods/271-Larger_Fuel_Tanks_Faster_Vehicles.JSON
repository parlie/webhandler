  "modShortDescription": "This mod increases the fuel capacity of the following: Auger, Chainsaw, Generator, Minibike, Motorcycle, Gyrocopter and 4x4 Truck.",
  "modDescription": "There are two versions of the mod. Don’t use both of them at the same time. Use one or the other.\n\n## Larger Fuel Tanks\n\ncoRpSE doesn’t know about you, but he really dislike the fuel tank sizes on everything from his [tools](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/) to his vehicles.\n\nConsistently refueling his auger is what got him to originally write this mod, and coming back recently and running into the same thing with refueling the auger, cause me to update this script. Well, a while back ago, he write a tutorial on how to modify your files to fix that issue, then early last year, 2019, he wrote it into a mod for Alpha 17.\n\nHe recently have returned and felt it was time to update this mod, so we could have the larger tanks once again and save our sanity when using the auger.\n\nThis mod increases the fuel capacity of the following:\n\n* Auger – 150% increase\n* Chainsaw – 100% increase\n* Generator – 100% increase\n* Minibike – 100% increase\n* Motorcycle – 100% increase\n* Gyrocopter – 150% increase\n* 4×4 Truck – 100% increase\n\nFor the most part, coRpSE has doubled the size of all the fuel tanks with a few exceptions. Of course, you can easily change the values if you like to have larger tanks than what he has preset.\n\nThis has only been tested on Alpha 18.4 (b4). Can’t confirm that this will work on Alpha 19 since he is not on it.\n\n## Faster Vehicles\n\nSome people that play on our server complained about how slow the [vehicles](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/) felt, especially the 4×4 truck, so coRpSE added a few lines of code into the Fuel mod to improve the overall speeds of the 4×4, motorcycle, and the minibike. He did not adjust the speed of the Gyrocopter because that he felt was good where it is.\n\nBoth the 4×4 and the motorcycle got over a 50% boost and the minibike just got a very slight bump in speed.\n\nIf you are running [Ragsy Racing Motorcycle Physics](https://7daystodiemods.com/improved-vanilla-motorcycle/) mod, then you will need to either delete or cancel out line 8 of the vehicles.xml in this mod.\n\nAny other mods that modify the speed of the 3 vehicles mentioned prior, may conflict with this mod.\n\nVehicle speed changes are as follows:\n\n* Minibike – From 7 Normal / 10 Boosted to 8 Normal / 11 Boosted\n* Motorcycle – From 9 Normal / 14 Boosted to 15 Normal / 23 Boosted\n* 4×4 Truck – From 9 Normal / 13 Boosted to 12 Normal / 20 Boosted\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wPi_OpARwE2F7ePtVDMzXk2yKFWmVuM7/view?usp=sharing)** Larger Fuel Tanks  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWwFbimZg9K3eWO8qjFEn9i5BPB-b-K3/view?usp=sharing)** Larger Fuel Tanks/Faster Vehicles\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19944-larger-fuel-tanks-faster-vehicles-alpha-18/).\n\n**Credits:** coRpSE",
