  "modDescription": "A simple XML mod that allows the player to repack loose ammo into boxes. Covers all bullets and shotgun shells ATM. I may add support later for arrows and bolts.\n\nThe ability to re-box [ammo](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-ammo/) is tied to the skills that allow you to craft boxes of ammo. Basically if you can craft a certain box of ammo, you can re-box that same ammo.\n\nLimitations â€“ Re-boxed ammo can not stack with crafted boxes and re-boxing ammo takes that same amount of time as crafting boxes. To re-box ammo requires a workbench, 100 rounds of the ammo plus 2 pieces of paper. Since it is XML only, it can be pushed from servers.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJ8Wx4urrOS65pVicYRt84FqDRQVkKIw/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [hip63](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/hip63/)",
