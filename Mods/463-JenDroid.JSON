  "modDescription": "Dayhawk has been watching several streamers it appears that [trader](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-trader/) Jen is the most loved trader in the game. It prompted him to write this mod. It does not require additional resource files so it is safe to use on a server without everyone downloading their own copy of the mod.\n\nWhen your survivor becomes a master at advanced engineering, you can now craft your own JenDroid! It requires a reasonable amount of materials and is geared towards mid to late game. She walks around your base and if your within 3 blocks of her she will increase your healing rate. She also can reduce the time for sprained or broken limbs by around 1/2\\. Nothing too over powerful but a fun little addition. Dayhawk plan on having droid versions of the other traders as he move forward.\n\n**Warning:** JenDroid has desires to wander the world and see new things. Handle this as you will.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/DayhawkSilverstar/7DaysToDieMods/tree/master/DayhawksJenDroid)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21381-a19-dayhawks-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** Dayhawk",
