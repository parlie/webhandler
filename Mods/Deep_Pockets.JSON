  "modDescription": "78 slot bigger backpack that must be earned through Pocket Mods, featuring full-size item icons.\n\nThis mod is designed for [Sorcery](https://7daystodiemods.com/sorcery-mod/) A19 as a standalone mod that can be used on its own. Simply download, extract and drag ‘n’ drop the “DeepPockets” folder into your “Mods” folder.\n\n## Changelog\n\nDeep Pockets has been updated to work properly with the latest version of A19!\n\nThe, IMO, redundant extra sort button has been reverted back to using the backpack icon to Sort Inventory. Makes the UI less cluttered.\n\n**Note:** Do not use this version of Deep Pockets with Sorcery. An enhanced, deeper feature, edition is used for Sorcery!\n\n**[Download](http://backpack.sorcerymod.com/)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19614-deep-pockets-large-backpack-large-icons/).\n\n**Credits:** [Devrix](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/devrix/)",
