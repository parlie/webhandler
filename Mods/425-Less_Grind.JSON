  "modDescription": "This mod increases the amount of resources obtained from many sources and also lowers the requirements for building some limited items. The intention is to lower the grind level of the game a bit, for those who don’t enjoy that aspect as much.\n\nChanges to recipes are minimal, but do includes things like:\n\n* [Foods](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/) that should, realistically, only need 1 or 2 meat to create now have lower meat requirements. He mean, c’mon, 5 raw meat to make 1 charred steak is a bit silly.\n* Iron bars now take 50% of the iron needed in vanilla (100 iron is a bit much for a single iron bar block)\n* He know they give you more bone’s for harvesting now, but you should still be able to make a bone knife with only one bone.\n* Bird Nests will now give more eggs.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-lessgrind)**\n\nIf you find any issues or have a suggestion for improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/issues) and Donovan will look into it ASAP.\n\n**Credits:** [Donovan](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/donovan/)",
