  "modShortDescription": "This mod allows you to increase or decrease selective electrical power attributes to match your own specifications.",
  "modDescription": "This mod allows you to increase or decrease selective [electrical](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-electricity/) power attributes to match your own specifications.\n\nThe current settings provide 400% of default values across multiple settings for generators, batteries, and solar. You can manually change this to decrease or increase default settings to provide a greater or more leisurely challenge. Ti2xGr was manually editing these values for his Geek Gaming server and this just formalises those actions into a mod.\n\nWhat do they all mean? Some are clear and others are more complex. Here are some images to show the clearer ones.\n\nThis is the impact of changing OutputPerStack for the battery bank. A level 6 battery changes from 50w to 200w giving a total of 1200w output.\n\nMaxPower appears to impact the total capacity. Default was 400w even though Tier 6 x 6 maxed out at 300w. Maybe this prepared for a future buff or mod?\n\nA single Tier 6 battery shows 200w output potential.\n\nAnd this reduces to reflect the lower Tier battery with a Tier 5 providing 183w.\n\nSolar power for a Tier 6 solar panel shows a proportional increase from 30w to 120w. Here is the solar bank loaded with 4 x Tier 6 and 2 x Tier 5 solar panels to give 698w out of a potential of 720w ‘MaxPower’ setting if they were all Tier 6.\n\nThe generator has ‘MaxFuel’ of 4000 as the image shows. Each engine ‘OutputPerStack’ is set to 400 but we can calculate this provides 200w per engine. This does not match the format for batteries and solar panels.\n\n## Generator\n\nAs for ‘OutputPerFuel’. This is probably linked to a formula of usage over time.\n\nAs for ‘MaxPower’. This may well also be linked to total overall output capacity over time.\n\n## Battery Bank\n\nAs for ‘InputPerTick’, ‘ChargePerInput’, and ‘OutputPerCharge’, in game these allow the batteries to recharge faster and hold their charge longer. He does not know the calculations for this. An old [Wiki post](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Battery_Bank) offers the following calculation for **default** values.\n\n### Battery Usage\n\nWhile turned on the battery bank will consume durability from batteries in its slots starting with the top left. These batteries will lose durability at a rate of 4 points per minute per watt. So if your battery bank was producing 45W of power it would use 4\\*45 = 180 durability per minute.\n\nminutes\\_of\\_charge = durability\\_of\\_battery / (4\\*power\\_usage)\n\n### Charging\n\nWhile charging it will consume 5w from the alternate power source (so to charge a battery bank you need system\\_power\\_cost+5w). While powered, it will regenerate durability in the battery inside, independent of quality, at a rate of 6 points per second. Batteries are charged in the sequence right to left, bottom to top. A 600 quality battery has 6000 durability so it would take about 16 minutes and 40 seconds to charge making the maximum time taken to fully recharge a battery bank 100 minutes.\n\nIf the above values are still relevant, this mod increases these 4 fold. He saw these calculations in the XML files some time ago but couldn’t find them after scanning again and can offer no further clarification. If any other community users can offer further clarification, it would be helpful.\n\n**blocks.xml**\n\n```\n<Config>\n\n<!--Generator-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='generatorbank']/property[@name='MaxFuel']/@value\">4000</set> <!-- X4 of default - Total amount of fuel the generator can hold -->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='generatorbank']/property[@name='OutputPerFuel']/@value\">45000</set> <!-- X4 of default-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='generatorbank']/property[@name='MaxPower']/@value\">49000</set> <!-- X4 of default-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='generatorbank']/property[@name='OutputPerStack']/@value\">400</set> <!-- X4 of default - Maximum power output of a single engine -->\n\n<!--Solar Bank-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='solarbank']/property[@name='OutputPerStack']/@value\">120</set> <!-- X4 of default - Maximum power output of a Lvl 6 solar cell -->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='solarbank']/property[@name='MaxPower']/@value\">720</set> <!-- X4 of default - Maximum combined output of all solar cells -->\n\n<!--Battery Bank-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='batterybank']/property[@name='MaxPower']/@value\">1600</set> <!-- X4 of default - Maximum combined output of all batteries -->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='batterybank']/property[@name='InputPerTick']/@value\">20</set> <!-- X4 of default-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='batterybank']/property[@name='ChargePerInput']/@value\">4</set> <!-- X4 of default-->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='batterybank']/property[@name='OutputPerStack']/@value\">200</set> <!-- X4 of default - Maximum power output of a Lvl 6 battery -->\n<set xpath=\"/blocks/block[@name='batterybank']/property[@name='OutputPerCharge']/@value\">360</set> <!-- X4 of default-->\n\n</Config>\n```\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/arramus/Electric-Buffs-A19/archive/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/22759-electric-buffs-a19/).\n\n**Credits:** [Arramus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/arramus/)",
