The options for trying to repair already corrupted files are limited and does not always work (as in my case). Even if the recovery methods work, you will still lose progress and it may even introduce bugs in the save. This app tries to mitigate these issues by creating a full backup of all your games save files each time you start the game. This app even keeps the previous backup as an extra precaution.\n\n## JSGME Mod Manager\n\nThe JSGME Mod Manager was created years ago to allow the management of mods for nearly every game imaginable. To this very day, I still have not found any software that does the task any better. It is very user friendly and freely available with permission is granted fordistribution. It’s a nice bit of kit.\n\nAll packaged in nice installer.\n\n_Game version:_ Any version\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zVjA9ILVUD1VhhNip8qV51Bq7hDyeu7J/view?usp=drivesdk)**\n\n**Credits:** [hip63](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/hip63/), Jonesoft",
