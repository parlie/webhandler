  "modDescription": "Random World Generation for 7 Days to Die. Generate beautiful and unique worlds for 7 Days to Die. Customize your worlds! Faster than vanilla!\n\n## USAGE\n\n* Download KingGen.\n* Run it.\n* Choose your preferences and click “Generate world”.\n* KingGen will create a folder containing the world. You have to copy it into 7 Days to Die’s worlds folder, usually: “%appdata%Roaming7 Days to DieGeneratedWorlds”\n\n## WHY KINGGEN?\n\n* The generated worlds are beautiful, with natural landscapes and large cities.\n* The generation is faster than vanilla, even on old machines.\n* Biomes are randomly placed, no repetitiveness.\n* Deserts and snow never touch.\n* KingGen is purely noise based, no stamps are used. This means that no two lakes look the same, nor two mountains.\n* Custom POIs are supported.\n* Custom heightmaps are supported.\n* Custom biome [maps](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/) are supported.\n\n**[Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kinggen/files/KingGen.exe/download)** Windows  \n**[Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kinggen/files/KingGen/download)** Linux\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23988-kinggen-a-random-world-generator-for-7-days-to-die/).\n\n**Credits:** KingSlayerGM",
