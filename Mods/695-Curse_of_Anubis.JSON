Create a new RWG world and the Prefabs should automaticaly spawn in rural and wilderness group in the Desert and Wasteland. If you want to change the spawns edit the prefab xml files. (thesphinx.xml and thepyramid.xml)\n\n7dtd has a problem with big [prefabs](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-prefab/) spawning automatically. It can be that none prefab spawns in the world. Then try a new seed or look for tuturials on how to spawn the prefab in an existing world as Andyjoki doesn’t know this part.\n\nAs example: You can generate a world seed and edit the rwgmixel.xml in %appdata% – look for you generated world and choose a prefab to swap with theSphinx or ThePyramid Prefab. Then start a new World with your edited GameSeed. The Prefabs should be at the location you put them.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j430x8ng2lpia32/curseofanubis.rar?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11922-curse-of-anubis-prefab-the-sphinx/).\n\n**Credits:** Andyjoki",
