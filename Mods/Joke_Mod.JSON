  "modDescription": "Welcome to Joke Mod!\n\nTHIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!\n\n## Version 2.0\n\nThis mod is about 85% a joke, 10% serious, 5% butterscotch ripple. It has been an idea for years and is finally a realization. It literally started as a joke and grew from there. The mod has been made so that players can have a serious playthrough and not just log in for 5 minutes, have some laughs, and never play it again. Although some people might still do that. Rude!\n\nThis mod was thought up/created by RizzoMF and Zilox with consultation from Khaine and killerbunny264\\.
