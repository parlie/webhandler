  "modDescription": "This is Saminal’s first public mod. It’s a server-side, XML-only mod. It started as three lines of xpath to unlock the Christmas items, for people who didn’t want to update to the Experimental build yet; but then after a quick chat in Discord he realised it would be fun to add a couple of damaging snowballs too.\n\nOne is a contact [grenade](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) type, with a very low radius of effect – this means you have to score a direct hit to get a kill.\n\nThe other is more like contact dynamite – it does block damage rather than entity damage. You can still singe your eyebrows if you’re not careful, however.\n\nThe Snowballnade is unlocked by the Contact Grenade schematic, and the Snowballmite by the Dynamite schematic. If you add this mod to an existing game and you’ve already read those, you will need to re-read them to unlock the new items.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eK6fVjOnUXafVJLxJDQvKCAdpbMyLUIB/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/22953-christmas-mod-vanilla-items-and-snowballs/).\n\n**Credits:** [Saminal](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/saminal/)",
