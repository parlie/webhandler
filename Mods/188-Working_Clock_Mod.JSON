The wall clock has that little red light bulb that lights up from 10pm to 4am.\n\nOne item modifier; goes into a helmet slot. Would work good for a mod where you don’t have a clock on the UI.\n\nSphereII did the c# code for the blocks, Adreden did the c# code for the item modifier, Guppycur did the unity side stuff.\n\nWant to use it in your mod? Credit the three of them.\n\nThis is a DMT mod. So requires [DMT Modding Tool](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/13037-dmt-modding-tool/). To install: Copy this mod to the Mods folder in DMT. Then Build.\n\nGuppycur has zero interest in tech supporting “how to install a dmt mod”.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/guppycur/guppymods/-/archive/master/guppymods-master.zip?path=GuppycurWorkingClock)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9144-guppycurs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/), SphereII, Adreden",
