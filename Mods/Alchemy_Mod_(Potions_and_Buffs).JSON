  "modDescription": "This is Poly’s first mod which she began developing in A19.\n\nThe original idea was to create a super simple mod in order to learn about modding, with the very first version

share it with the community.\n\nThe mod adds [potions](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-drinks/) to the game, which when consumed give the player a temporary buff.\n\nPotions, Elixirs and
