  "modShortDescription": "Completely changing vehicles and how they work, this mod will not let you build cars in the vanilla style. You will come across a variety of vehicles in the world.",
  "modDescription": "Guppycur is separating this from his mods thread because this is more of an overhaul mod. Many thanks to Mumpfy for helping Guppycur out with some textures.\n\nThis is still a **Work in Progress**, so only download and install if you don’t mind daily changes.\n\nThe following features may or may not be implemented:\n\nCompletely changing 7DTD [vehicles](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/) and how they work, this mod will **not** let you build [cars](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-car-mods/) in the vanilla style. You will come across a variety of vehicles in the world, from firetrucks to humvee’s to police cars to sedans, and even a monster [truck](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-truck-mods/), you can only **hope** they are running. If not, you’ll be forced to loot them to find salvageable parts, such as:\n\n* Chassis (and broken version)\n* Transmission (and broken version)\n* Engine (and broken version)\n* Seats (and broken version)\n* Carburetor (and broken version)\n* Battery (and broken version)\n* Wheels (and broken version)\n* Alternator (and broken version)\n\nYou can then, after learning how, assemble these using a custom auto-workshop bench, to finally learn how to assemble **basic** car types. A Sedan, a Truck, and a [Motorcycle](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-motorcycle/). You can only use the cool stuff like firetrucks, police cars and 5ton military trucks by finding driveable versions!\n\nBooks will be required to learn how to make the assemblies, and it’ll be more like **real life** so to speak.\n\nGas will be at a premium.\n\nTires that you find on the ground? They can be picked up! But, they are **not wheels**. You must find a broken wheel (rim), and with the help of the air compressor in the auto-workshop bench, create a functional wheel that you can use to build your cars.\n\nMore to come. No reservations necessary.\n\nHe has included a beta version of his Guppycur World, which is completely void of prefabs, so is there just to check out how it’s coming.\n\nThis mod is only available on the [MOD LAUNCHER](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/4068-the-7d2d-mod-launcher-a-mod-launcher-for-7-days-to-die/) (unless you know how to install SDX mods manually). This is important, because the launcher will compile the custom script for you and be transparent to you.\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11755-guppycurs-vehicle-madness-overhaul/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/)",
