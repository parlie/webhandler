  "modDescription": "Aesthetic/cosmetic mod. Pretty much adds a recipe that allows you to craft a charcoal grill and a wood burning stove that acts as a reskinned campfire.\n\nAll campfire recipes work the same as vanilla.\n\nThe video below showcases the mod working correctly. The names of the blocks have been improved to show the spaces (“Working Wood Burning Stove” instead of “WorkingWoodBurningStove”) and the fire affect for the Stove is set properly. The fire for the Grill is still as seen in the video… because EpicSpire does not know how to scale the size of it.\n\n## Changelog\n\nMinor fix. (recipes.xml)\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1npnFGddPgm-sY2-u8AnDDVhxaL7L3osG)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/22404-epicspires-working-grill-and-wood-burning-stove/).\n\n**Credits:** [EpicSpire](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/epicspire/)",
