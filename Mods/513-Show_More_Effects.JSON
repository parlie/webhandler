  "modDescription": "This mod allows you to show in the list of effects which glasses worn by the character, and whether wearing super sneakers, accelerating a jacket or a cigar.\n\nThis mod Survager made only for himself, but decided to share with you, and therefore do not need to write to him that this mod is useless. Or you use this mod or not in use.\n\nDuring the game, Survager often change him glasses and other items of [clothing](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-clothing/), which give certain bonuses:\n\n* If he scoured the boxes, he wear Aviator Goggles\n* If he create things, he wear Nerd Glasses\n* If he develop a character in the perception, he wear Shades when he fight with zombies, and so on.\n\nSurvager often forget to change glasses, but in order to determine which glasses he’s wearing, he need to open a window each time a character – it’s uncomfortable. Do not open the window every time a character to learn what subjects are wearing, he made this mod.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ii0HP8jqwu1XySM_ILgkwbpI4DMmPEe)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/20026-modlet-show-more-effects/).\n\n**Credits:** [Survager](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/survager/)",
