  "modDescription": "This mod adds a new Tier 1 POI to explore. This POI was actually a house that Telric and a few friends built in a clean playthrough. He exported it and did a little redesign to make it a dungeon crawl and look closer to a vanilla style POI (heâ€™s still very new to this aspect of [prefabbing](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-prefab/)). There is an additional quest chain that can be gotten from the mailbox at this house. Find out a little information about the survivors from this house. This house can also be targeted for vanilla [quests](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-quests/) like fetch, clear all, and fetch/clear.\n\nRequires restart. Requires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.4 b3\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer, however the quest portion of this POI can only be completed by one person at a time since upgrade objectives are not shared with party yet.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c7ooif9yqkl1zxk/TelricsSurvivorHouseAPrefabA19.7z?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19976-telrics-a19-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Telric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/telric/)",
