  "modDescription": "This 7DTD mod adds some quality bonuses to both Entity and Block Damage.\n\nIt is percentage based for now and adds 20% per quality level to entity damage (0% for 1, and 100% for level 6). It also adds 40% to block damage per quality level (0-200%). Luc added this in, as it felt like there was less of a reason to worry about quality level unless you had mods on hand, which are few and far between.\n\nIt should stack as a modlet without issues, it removes all other perc\\_adds to items and then adds these to all items found (with special changes to items like the AK that normally have custom perc\\_adds).\n\n**[Download](https://cdgroup.org/files/7dtd/QualityDamageBonuses.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/8777-lucs-modlet-collection-quality-bonuses-better-stamina-terrain-mv-spd-etc/).\n\n**Credits:** [Elucidus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/elucidus/)",
