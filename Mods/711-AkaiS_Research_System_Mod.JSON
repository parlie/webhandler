  "modDescription": "When Playing 7D2D, most of the time you spec into an attribute and spend skill points on [perks](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-perks/) within it, well this mod is going to help you spec into other Fighting Perks.\n\nGather Research papers and use it in combination with your loot to gain [skill points](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-skill-points/) in a skill branch.\n\nAkaiS Research System adds a tool to the workbench to allow for research work, but it is expensive. For example: Use the Research papers with rifle parts and a hunting rifle to craft a [book](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-books/) that gives you a point in “Dead Eye” perk. Another example: Use the Research papers with steel spear parts and a spear to craft a book that gives you a point in “Javelin Master” perk.\n\nThis mod is Vanilla-friendly and uses vanilla-edited assets (Mainly Icons).\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HzVEthFJwIZXOSjRXJxjFr_0FF2kJjNm/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** Akai Shuichi",
