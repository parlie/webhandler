  "modDescription": "This is a simple mod that provides two functions:\n\n* Gives a 10% chance of receiving 1 or 2 eggs from cutting down a tree and ‘shaking’ any bird’s nests from the branches.\n* Gives a 50% chance of harvesting 1 to 4 eggs from a Chicken using a proper butchering tool or 1 or 2 eggs when using any other tool.\n\nThese will add a couple more ways to acquire [eggs](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/) in context.\n\nThis mod was requested from the mjota.net community which runs both a Vanilla and Server Side Mod server and appears to be for a particular player that uses the highly appropriate name of ‘Sgt Eggs’.\n\nTree felling and shaking an egg from a nest.\n\nIf you would like to raise your own Chickens in a Chicken Coop to receive feathers, eggs, and your very own pet Chicken, Oakraven has created the [Oak’s Pets, Farm Animals, and Jeep mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/oaks-pet-animals-guards-and-farm-jeep/) which adds a whole new dimension to farming.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/arramus/Egg-Hunt/archive/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23247-egg-hunt/).\n\n**Credits:** [Arramus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/arramus/)",
