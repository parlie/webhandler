  "modDescription": "This mod will add an additional [farm](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-farming/) plot recipe. The current recipe will still work, but you will have the option of using this recipe as well. It is built from using Potted Plants (treePlant02) as the base. Since it is already a potted plant, it does not require any nitrate or rotten flesh.\n\nThe recipe itself may need some adjustment, but seems to be pretty good. With additional input, Mlburgoon may change the recipe requirements if enough people feel it is off.\n\n* 4 – wood\n* 8 – Potted Plants\n* 40 – Clay\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1BzXYDX2_jMq2gbGKE9kOjT6S16Cl4rWj)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/18587-modlet-additional-farmplot-recipe/).\n\n**Credits:** [Mlburgoon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/mlburgoon/)",
