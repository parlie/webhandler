  "modDescription": "This mod comes in 2 versions: a plain [truck](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-truck-mods/) and then a Hostess version. So you’ll always have Twinkies on hand during the apocalypse!\n\n## Features\n\n* Has it’s own recipe, using 4×4 parts. So, obviously unlocking the 4×4 Truck is required to craft this.\n* Each truck takes: 6 Wheels, 2 engines, 2 batteries, 4×4 chassis, and 4×4 accessories.\n* Has high amount of storage, and holds a lot of gas. It isn’t very fast, turns kinda slow and burns gas faster than a 4×4.\n\nBdubyah thanks to DUST2DEATH for helping him in this work.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **_(new)_** Fixed missing progression unlocks for Box Truck parts.\n* Recipe fix.\n* Added new engine/horn sounds.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/bdubyah/Mods---A19/tree/master/Box%20Truck)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/bdubyah/Mods---A18/tree/master/Box%20Truck)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11875-bdubyahs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Bdubyah](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/bdubyah/)",
