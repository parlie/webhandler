  "modDescription": "This is a fairly small 7 Days to Die mod that does a few things. It removes the players ability to mount the standard reflex sight on [pistols](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/), and adds a small RMR optic for players to find and use instead.\n\nIt functions equally to the vanilla reflex and has a proper illuminated reticle. You can find it anywhere youâ€™d be able to find a full size reflex.\n\n**Changelog**\n\n* 1.0: Initial release\n* 1.05: Restructured xpath more elegantly, improving compatibility with other mods.\n* 1.1: Raised red dot a bit to improve lower visibility and fine tuned materials. Also increased camera zoom slightly to better match vanilla.\n* 1.11: Fixed magnum offsets.\n\n**[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ibr6fjt3zrxwea1/Vanilla_Pistol_RMR_Replacer_1-11.zip/file)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17701-replacement-rmr-for-vanilla-pistols/).\n\n**Credits:** [Sykriss](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/sykriss/)",
