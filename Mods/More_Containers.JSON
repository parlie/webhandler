  "modDescription": "Do you have friends that can’t help themselves and store everything in a specific box for each type of items? Eric Beaudoin does. This mod adds new graphic designs for the [storage](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-storage/) boxes and also add half-block versions of the storage boxes (for more headspace).\n\nThe new designs are added to the Wooden Storage / Furniture variant block. When the new containers are destroyed, they are put in the player inventory. This allow players to move the containers or to select a different design.\n\n**Note:** The mod has been tested and works with Alpha 20.\n\n## Changelog\n\n**v1.8: Fix for Alpha 20**\n\n* Created a Storage Boxes variant helper block for Alpha 20\n* Fix the Variant menu order\n\n**v1.7: More ammo crates**\n\n* Added crates and half-crates for 9mm, arrow, magnum, and shell ammo\n* Added crates and half-crates for melee and range weapons\n\n**v1.6: Crates for mod parts**\n\n* Changed the modding design (its purpose was not clear enough)\n* Added designs for Armor, Vehicle (in preparation for Alpha 20), and Weapon Mods crates and half-crates\n* Fix a typo that was there since forever, if you used an ammo crate of half-crate, you will probably have to remove it with and place it back\n\n**v1.5: Even more crates**\n\nCement Mixer, Chemistry, Crafting, Electricity, Gas, Gun Craft, Modding, Plants, Resources, Tool Smithing\n\n**v1.4: New crates**\n\nNew Auto Parts and Workbench designs\n\n**v1.3: Bug fixes**\n\n* Secure Armors Storage now available to players (only could use Insecure version before)\n* Writable Storage now get drop in your inventory if you destroy it\n\n**v1.2: Alpha 19 fixes**\n\n* Fix: The wood container variant block changed name with Alpha 19\n* Work on textures to make them look better with new lighting system\n\n**v1.1:** Rebuilt assets for the new linear lighting (Alpha 19)\n\n**v1.0: First official version which includes**\n\n* New design for generic, armors, barter (trader), forge, mining, and recycle storage boxes\n* Everything is also available in half-cube format\n* All new storage boxes are added to the wood storage and furniture helper\n\nNone of this would have been possible without Xyth work on [Fun With Flags](https://7daystodiemods.com/flags-mod/) and his [video tutorials](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9014-unity-tutorials-for-7d2d-modders/).\n\n**Important:** For this mod to work properly, it needs to be installed on the server and every player’s computer.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/Laotseu/7dtdMods/releases/download/MoreContainers_v1.8/MoreContainers_v1.8.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21570-morecontainers-v14-alpha-19/).\n\n**Credits:** [Eric Beaudoin](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/eric-beaudoin/)",
