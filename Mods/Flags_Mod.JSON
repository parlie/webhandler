  "modDescription": "Some new craftable flags, make your own fun flag today! The A19 version uses a custom shader to add cloth motion features. A18/A17 used cloth physics. Shader motion is lighter on the FPS than using cloth physics. Some are using the looted flag to mark areas that are already looted.\n\nAnd now even better with RallyPoint Flags!\n\nLatest edition to flags collection. Embarrassed when your clan gathers around a cartoon bouncing exclamation point before braving a group quest? No more. Now you can make you own custom guild flag that marks the beginning of your end. Included are 5 rally flags, just edit the xpath blocks.xml file and pick the one you like best. Xyth will upload a rallyflag template to his repo soon in case you want to make your own.\n\n## Changelog\n\nMinor update to the flags, added missing normal maps so they look better in game.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/7D2D/A19Mods/tree/master/FunwithFlags)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/7D2D/A18Mods/tree/master/FunwithFlags)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/8400-xyths-modlet-collection/).\n\n**Credits:** [Xyth](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/xyth/), Sheldon Cooper",
