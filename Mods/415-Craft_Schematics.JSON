  "modDescription": "Have you ever found a weapon mod, but wished you had the schematic for it instead? Well, now you can!\n\nUsing the table saw, some paper, glue, and leather you can turn that mod into a schematic of the same type!\n\nOf course, in order to make the schematic, the original mod will be consumed in the process, but youâ€™ll have a shiny new schematic to read!\n\nNot to mention, you will finally have a good use for that table saw you just had to have, but now sits in your crafting area collecting dust.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/tree/stable/donovan-craftschematics)**\n\nIf you find any issues or have a suggestion for improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Donovan522/donovan-7d2d-modlets/issues) and Donovan will look into it ASAP.\n\n**Credits:** [Donovan](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/donovan/)  \n_Special Thanks:_ Steveburger",
