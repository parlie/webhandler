  "modShortDescription": "Ride in style with the newest compact size chopper1 helicopter. An easier and faster way to get to where you need to go.",
  "modDescription": "The Chopper1 is equipped with three spotlights to see clearer while in flight.\n\nThere are decals placed onto the textures for that rustic apocalyptic feel.\n\nIt is sure to be a smoother ride with tighter control for flight simulation. Ride in style with the newest compact size chopper1 [helicopter](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/). An easier and faster way to get to where you need to go.\n\n* **Vehicle Name:** [Helicopter](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/helicopter-91366449ce6842f784748a914e29d641)\n* **3D Model Artists Name:** [irs1182](https://sketchfab.com/irs1182)\n* All Models in this mod are subject to [creative commons licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n* No Models have been altered from the ‘original creator’ they are set up with an extra overlay texture and appropriate lighting shader in unity for 7 Days to Die game.\n\nThis version has an alternate vehicle file for those that like the older style heli controls Ragsy and Bdub came up with for the [MD 500](https://7daystodiemods.com/md-500/) way back. Just simply rename existing vehicles.xml to oldvehicles.xml and rename the one called RagsnBdubstyleoldvehicles.xml to vehicles.xml\n\n**Important Note:** If you want to include any of their mods in your overhaul please do them the courtesy of asking for permission first.
