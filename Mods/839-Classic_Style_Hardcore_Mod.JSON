  "modDescription": "Classic Style Hardcore continues to develop the original idea laid down in the early Alphas of 7 Days to Die.\n\nBut there are many changes associated with improvement in favor of modernity. n2n1 introduce innovations, but he try to be careful with the original material and the atmosphere from Initial 7DTD. This is going in the direction of hardcore survival. The entry threshold is very high, but this is the price for deep gameplay – this is unavoidable.\n\nThis is about **Survival**. Do **Reasonable Things** or **You Fail**.\n\nHere you can see how people who are not afraid of difficulties play this mod:\n\nHere is a right attitude to survival, in Japanese:\n\nA look at the past. A16 in 2021 (Russian language):\n\nSeason#2 from Dayther やまだ (In Japanese):\n\nMod showcase from channel Camoes Gamer:\n\nThese great tools used to create this mod:\n\n* “Prefab Editor” (Thanks Pillle)\n* “UABE” (Thanks DerPopo)\n* “Hal’s Prefab Editor” (Thanks HAL9000)\n\n## Changelog\n\n**HOTFIX for CSH v19.5.00**\n\nThis IMPORTANT hotfix returns the display of XP without which it was not possible to get XP. (there are also changes in the mod-launcher)\n\nYou can compensate for the lost XP by entering the console command “giveselfxp”. Can calculate the approximate amount of XP by the number of zombies killed (shown on the character tab).\n\nThe number of zombies is multiplied by the average XP they give (let it be \\~450-500). Now substitute the resulting number instead of XXX and enter it into the console: giveselfxp XXX\n\nHis apologies.\n\n## Terms of Use\n\n1.
