  "modDescription": "This is a small mod AaronG85 modified based on the work of [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/).\n\nThis changes the boulders (ResourceStones) in game to give you a small chance at [mining](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-mining/): Coal, Potassium Nitrate Powder, Lead, Sand and Clay\n\nThis also gives you a rare chance of mining: Brass, Silver, Gold and Dimond\n\nAlso gives the ability to mine a small amount of iron from terrestrial stone boulders.\n\nThe percentages can be changed higher or lower to suit your gaming needs via the blocks.xml.\n\n**NOTE:** This changes all boulders currently, If anyone has any tips on how to make the changes ONLY affect the ResourceStone Boulder, not the specialized boulders, they are very welcome to [PM](https://community.7daystodie.com/profile/17912-aarong85/) him so he can implement it.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rI34W9VePcpvOIZQqCogfLudb80GL36u)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19748-aarong85s-ultimate-rock-a19/).\n\n**Credits:** [AaronG85](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/aarong85/)",
