  "modDescription": "Regeneration getting you down? Have one of your party members hold this item, and the glowies in a 15 block area will stop regenerating! You’ll have to protect your guy, but the price you pay!\n\nThis 7 Days to Die mod allows one of your party members to hold and object that will remove the regeneration effect of radiated zombies in a 15 block area.\n\nSo basically, this is not a single player mod. One person from your party holds it, while the others protect him and don’t have to suffer the effects of regenerating radiated zombies.\n\nGuppycur has not made a [recipe](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-recipes/) for this, and this is not the final model.\n\nAs an added bonus, whoever is holding this is uh, very very attractive to [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/).\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/guppycur/guppymods/-/archive/master/guppymods-master.zip?path=Guppycur%27s_Rad_Dampener)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9144-guppycurs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/), PV Wolfgang",
