  "modDescription": "Unforgiven254’s friend Oocia came up with an idea Why not add Brass as a harvestable item from the large [boulders](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-mining/) in the world? As you know sometimes playing on multiplayer servers or playing solo can be a pain as resources can be hard to come by in early game.\n\nOocia came up with the idea of adding Brass to boulders. As he didn’t know how to use xpath he added the information manually. But thanks to SphereII’s Xpath tutorial. Unforgiven254 was able to come up with a small modlet that adds brass to boulders in the world.\n\nCurrently it is set to Unforgiven254’s servers settings. For survival enter at your own risk mod. He is releasing this as Oocia’s idea. But as his code and thanks to Bdubyah. Bdubyah was able to help him fix his mistakes.\n\nUnforgiven254 is proud to release to the community and this modlet is free for all to modify and use to your liking. This will also be avalible on the mod launcher soon.\n\n_This is Unforgiven254’s first Xpath modlet._\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/army.bratt44/mods/-/archive/master/mods-master.zip?path=Mods/Unforgivens%20Brass%20From%20Biomes)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/18004-my-first-xpath-modlet-thanks-to-a-friends-idea/).\n\n**Credits:** Unforgiven254, Oocia",
