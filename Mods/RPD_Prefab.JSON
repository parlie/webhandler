  "modDescription": "This is a [prefab](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-prefab/) build based on Resident Evil’s Raccoon City Police Department. The building was made using the blueprints available in the game and decorated as closely as possible to what can be seen in various screenshots.\n\nThere will be some discrepancies as 7 days does not have certain props which are essential to making a 100 percent accurate replica, but this shouldn’t stop anyone from being able to recognize the rooms as they make their way through.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FyTQYc9rxys5UTIdLJC9T6igLV0271Yl/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nIf you appreciate ChaoticCreative’s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](https://paypal.me/wheeloflight?locale.x=en_US).\n\n**Credits:** ChaoticCreative",
