  "modDescription": "This mod slows the player down when walking through grass.\n\n* Default is 20% slower than vanilla.\n* Decrease in movement speed when walking through the various grasses. Gives reason to clearing an area you walk often.\n* Can be adjusted in the xml file easily to suit your needs.\n* Configured to work with the Walk Slower mod. Without the walk slower mod the change in speed is more dramatic. Increase 10% if not using it.\n\n**Updated to v1.1**  \nAdds a couple missed bushes/grasses.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Su1C1daL/Su1C1dal-7DTD-Mods/tree/master/Su1C1dal%207DTD%20Grass%20Walking%20Slowdown)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19055-su1c1dal-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Su1C1daL](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/su1c1dal/)",
