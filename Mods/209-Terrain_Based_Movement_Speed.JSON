  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod increases and decreases speed of walking and running on different terrains. For instance, walking on roads now provides a movement boost, while walking through snow and sand decreases movement speed. It does this both for zombies and players though.\n\nCompatible with Alpha 18 game version, will need to check for new Terrain Types, sidewalks no longer exist.\n\n**[Download](http://cdgroup.org/files/7dtd/TerrainBasedMovementSpeed.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/8777-lucs-modlet-collection-quality-bonuses-better-stamina-terrain-mv-spd-etc/).\n\n**Credits:** [Luc](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/luc/)",
