  "modDescription": "Navezgane is great, but it gets boring after a while. Random World Generator (RWG) [maps](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/) are hit or miss, but are often miss with too little of certain biomes, too few of the high-quality buildings, and towns located too heavily or sparsely in each biome.\n\nSlickster43 took a vanilla RWG 4K map ([KeyedDops](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19792-alpha-19-seed-thread/)) and modified the list of POIs and Spawn Points. The map now contains 10 traders, including one in every town or city, and at least one of every high-value POI (stores, skyscrapers, army camps, etc). There are towns in every biome type. This map is being used on servers, such as the Dire Moon Gaming private server.\n\n**To add this to your game:**\n\n1. Open a new File Manager window and type %appdata%\n2.
