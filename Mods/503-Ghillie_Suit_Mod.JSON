  "modDescription": "Turns the Ghillie Suit into a cosmetic mod, similar to the Cowboy/Ballcap mods.\n\nThis cool armor doesn’t seem to be utilized because of the huge amount of hypo/hyperthermal resist that you have to give up in Jacket/Pant slots and huge Armor loss for the headpiece. By the time you find all the Sniper books, you’re too far in gamestage to give that up. Now, you can install it as a mod, and rock that yeti look.\n\nThis mod adds a “jacket” tag to all existing jackets, but won’t work with modded jackets unless they extend existing ones.\n\n## Changelog\n\nFixed display on hood.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/stamplesmods/7d2dmodlets/tree/master/GhillieSuitAsMods)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/16096-stamples-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Stample](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/stample/)",
