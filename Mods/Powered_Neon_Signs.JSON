  "modDescription": "[Neon Signs](https://7daystodiemods.com/neon-signs/) updated for A20! These neon signs require power and can be toggled on/off like a normal light. They also can be picked up if inside a land claim zone.\n\nAll credit for this mod goes to Three08\\. I have just updated it to work with A20 and added a few tweaks such as a recipe for crafting the signs.\n\nThese neon [lights](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-lights/) can be unlocked by Advanced Engineering level 3 or by schematic. They can also be found in loot.\n\n## Included Signs\n\n* Open x 3\n* Gun\n* Pizza\n* Bowling\n* Chinese Food\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is a C# mod so EAC must be OFF.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Zilox135/A20Modlets/tree/main/Neon%20Signs)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/28158-powered-neon-signs/).\n\n**Credits:** [Zilox](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/zilox/), Three08",
