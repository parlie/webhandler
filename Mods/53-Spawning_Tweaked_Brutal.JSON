  "modDescription": "Some said, 7 Days to Die is easier nowadays. Claymore agree, but this 7DTD mod is something to consider done in plain insanity. He appended an own group of zombies, including everything hard to kill you. Even Grace is now spawning naturally (again).\n\n* The Pine Forest and Desert will make you to bury yourself in the night. Nice green colors… everywhere!\n* Wasteland is now a place, you shouldn’t go to – even properly equipped, you might have a bad time. No matter of time.\n* [Zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) hate too high and low temperatures. The only places with “normal” zombies are the Burnt Forest and Snow. But you have to deal with the temperature.\n\nIf you plan to stream it: Claymore would be glad to hear from you.\n\nCompatibility: **A18+**\n\n**[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/x0m24oypebsfzbs/Claymore_Spawning_Tweaked_Brutal.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/15031-claymores-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Claymore](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/claymore/)",
