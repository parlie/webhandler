  "modDescription": "Adds some [NPC](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-npcs/) Soldiers to the game â€“ does not add into spawn groups!\n\n9 new soldiers, slightly different MoCap packages, includes machine gunners, a rocket launcher guy and a flame thrower guy. Be warned, the default **AI packages are very limited**, so they shoot like storm troopers. Until TFP fixes the NRE that occurs when a bandit class enters a trader protected area, they are pretty limited on what they can include.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/guppycur/guppymods/-/archive/master/guppymods-master.zip?path=Guppycur%27s_Soldiers)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9144-guppycurs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/)",
