  "modDescription": "This changes the crafting system by removing the ability to just craft after learning the perk. It now requires you to read the schematic and have a point in the perk to be able to craft items.\n\nThere is a work around if you want to test out certain weapons, If you acquire enough schematics of a given item you will be able to craft a level 1 and try the weapon out. The leveling of weapons still goes off of the [perks](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-perks/), so if you want to craft higher tier gear you need to spend the points.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1JhVZPxDePq1B-uNzwVZaqjopCBUu55gW)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21700-rickyralph-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Rickyralph](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/rickyralph/)",
