  "modDescription": "This 7DTD mod adds [slots](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-more-slots/) for adding 5 additional recipe ingredients to make a total of 10 ingredients. This is for cases where modding the game has resulted in >5 ingredients for a recipe.\n\nNormally recipes in the vanilla game do not have >5 ingredients but if mods are added itâ€™s possible (either by design or accident) that recipes could have >5 ingredients. Without this mod if a recipe has >5 ingredients you can still craft the recipe but you will not be able to view any more than 5 ingredients. This mod is the best workaround he can come up with to add more ingredients (so you can see them) as he could not find a way to make the ingredient list scrollable.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a19/tree/main/Doughs-UIAddFiveRecipeIngredients)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a18/tree/main/Doughs-UIAddFiveRecipeIngredients)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
