  "modDescription": "This mod adds a new Tier 3 POI to explore. Follow Siera Nightstalker throughout the mansion and find out what happened within. Help her defeat the final boss, which will be quite a fight considering how powerful she is. If you played this POI in alpha 18, there has been a few changes to make it work in alpha 19\\. Itâ€™s now a valid target for fetch and clear [quests](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-quests/).\n\nRequires restart. Requires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.4 b3\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer, however the quest portion of this POI can only be completed by one person at a time since upgrade objectives are not shared with party yet.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jwzqxhp6yeiznq2/TelricsMagistersMansionA19.zip?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19976-telrics-a19-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Telric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/telric/)",
