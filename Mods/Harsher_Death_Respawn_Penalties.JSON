  "modDescription": "A lot of talk on here about death penalties. This will add some weight to your death. It will keep all buffs on you like broken arms and legs and infection. It will no longer replenish your food and water but rather it will respawn you with 50 percent of each. Infection will persist until it hits 100 percent. When you die to it it will clear it. Great for those who wish for death to NOT be the easy way out.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/JaxTeller718/A20ModletsJax/tree/main/JaxTeller718-HarsherDeathPenalties)**\n\nIf you appreciate JaxTeller718â€™s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](https://www.paypal.me/FrankCirabisiJr).\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/25860-jaxteller718s-a20-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [JaxTeller718](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/jaxteller718/)",
