  "modDescription": "This 7DTD mod makes the [solar cell and bank](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-electricity/) recipes unlockable via Yeah Science. Cell quality and recipe cost scales with Yeah Science level.\n\nJust something Andrough was messing around with to learn a little more. He is not sure his change to the node in progression is the most elegant way to do it, but it works without interfering with other recipe unlocks. Again, some may find the recipes unbalanced. Youâ€™re welcome to change whatever you like with either.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/andrough/7D2DvA18/tree/master/AYS/androughYeahSolar)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/16187-andrough-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Andrough](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/andrough/)",
