  "modDescription": "Need something with more comfort than the rough-edged gyrocopter? The UH-60 should suit you perfectly!\n\n* It requires Grease Monkey level 5 to craft.\n* Has same storage as the gyro, but can carry a total of 6 people.\n* High fuel consumption, but holds quite a bit.\n* Has a wide search light.\n\nDoes fly a bit odd. Doesn’t have any roll to it, so it can be tricky lining up landings just right.\n\nLike the gyrocopter, “W” is lift, “A” and “D” turn it, “S” makes it fall quicker, “C” rotates the nose down and “Space” rotates the nose up.\n\n## Changelog\n\nAdded new engine/horn sounds.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/bdubyah/Mods---A19/tree/master/UH-60)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/bdubyah/Mods---A18/tree/master/UH-60)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11875-bdubyahs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Bdubyah](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/bdubyah/)",
