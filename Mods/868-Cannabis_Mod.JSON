  "modDescription": "Everyone needs a little downtime, right? Find, grow, and smoke your own cannabis. Sure, it’ll make you a little hungry, but you sure take some punishment when you’re high. This mod adds seeds, plants, schematics, progression, buffs, and usable items.\n\n## Using This Mod\n\nTo get started, start looting around until you find some cannabis seeds or (cannabis buds and the perk or recipe to craft seeds from it). Plant the seeds as you would any other and wait for your cannabis to grow.\n\nCannabis can be rolled into joints or smoked in bongs that you can craft or find.\n\nSmoking cannabis joints will give you damage protection and a bit of fortitude for a few minutes. It’ll also heal you (like weak [painkillers](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-medical-supplies/)), but you’ll lose some perception and a bit of max stamina (got the munchies?) in exchange. The perception, fortitude, and damage protection effects are temporary. Smoking cannabis in a bong will give you a more potent effect.\n\n## Note For Multiplayer\n\nThe current version of Alpha 19 does not push localization data to users. If you are playing multiplayer (either hosting or via dedicated server), each player will need to install the cannabis mod themselves to get the proper descriptions of items, buffs, perks, etc. that this mod changes.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **_(new)_** Updated to support A19 now. (Official Update)\n* Updated for A19 by Doughphunghus.\n* Updated to v1.01 with new Cannabis plant models.
