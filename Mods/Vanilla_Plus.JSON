  "modDescription": "TL;DR Description: MASSIVELY Enhanced Vanilla Friendly Gameplay. Build/Upgrade “ALL” Blocks. Simplification of building through MISC System. Bundle MANY things. MURDER AXE. Many Fixes. Vehicle Seating+. Ammo Scrapping Improvement. Wasteland Mining. Entity Death Improvements. Max Level 1000\\. MASTER Skill Tree. Label Improvements. AND SO MUCH MORE!\n\n## Main Features 1 Through 9\n\n**1) ALL BLOCKS** – 158 shapes are now upgradeable and buildable. Start with wood, iron, or rebar frames, flagstone, wet concrete, or bulletproof glass. Except for glass, all upgrade paths end at stainless steel.\n\n**2) MISC Blocks** – A lot of miscellaneous block types in wood and iron form. For example: [doors](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-doors/), ladders, catwalks, ibeams, fences, and several mundane traps. New progression system of wood to reinforced wood, to iron, to steel. Blocks found in the world upgrade into this progression system.\n\n**3) Bundle+ and Supply Blocks** – All [books](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-books/) and schematics are re-readable. Bundle volumes 1-7 into a single collection. Bundle ALL the collections into a single Encyclopedia. Bundle a large variety of items, unlocked across specified skills and books. Additional description in game is provided. Craft these bundles into a placeable block that is easily picked up.\n\n**4) New Things & Fixes** – Personal favorite is the MURDER AXE, essentially an axe that swings like a sledge [hammer](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/) and follows the deep cuts skills. Armor Vision mods into chest and/or helmet. Honey, eggs, and feather harvesting. Paintless Painting. Scrap batteries into Acid…. and so much more.\n\n**5) Seating Plus** – 5 people can sit in a truck, 2 on a motorcycle.\n\n**6) Scrapping Plus** – ALL [ammunition](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-ammo/) scraps into a “bundle” that when open, returns an appropriate amount of associated resources.\n\n**7) Wasteland Plus** – Upgrading Treasure Hunter unlocks the ability to harvest additional resources from Wasteland Debris (not fallen debris). Details are easily seen in skill descriptions.\n\n**8) Entity Death Plus** – Zombies leave harvestable guts. [Animal](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-animals/) corpses last 20 minutes. Loot bags last 10 hours. Watch out for the fat cop’s exploding guts that can be picked up as a landmine.\n\n**9) Master Skills** – Check out the new skill progression of levels 250 up to 1,000\\. Master version items along with other enhancement available.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DzX2xZ8KA5XK9QWa90fi1arsNGaukH_/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nIf you need help, you can use this [support link](https://discord.gg/Vm5eyW6N4r).\n\n**Credits:** [Riles](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/riles/)",
