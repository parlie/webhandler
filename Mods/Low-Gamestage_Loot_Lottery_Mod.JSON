  "modDescription": "This is a silly little mod that just changes the standard loot probability tables to give .001 prob value to T1/T2/T3 at gamestages where otherwise they would be 0.\n\nOnly tested to be syntactically valid, not tested so much for balance. However if his math is correct, at GS 1 it ought to give a 1/1000 chance of a T1/T2/T3 weapon, tool, or armor, and a 4/1000 chance of T2 or T3 ammo from a Shotgun Messiah crate. Other containers, YMMV; he’s not prepared to do all that math yet.\n\nSomebody in General mentioned wanting a “winning the lottery” sort of chance for higher-tier stuff at low GS. This mod should do that. He think. He doesn’t plan on running it in his own game so he won’t really get any test results. He did open about 100 S.M. crates at GS 26 and still only got GS 26-appropriate loot according to vanilla probabilities. Didn’t hit the lottery he suppose.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1eqTIezlkLI7-YtUA3uleppQeiC-78pxK)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21442-a19-low-gamestage-loot-lottery-modlet/).\n\n**Credits:** [Boidster](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/boidster/)",
