  "modDescription": "A decoration pack that will slowly be added to over time. These are Telric’s own models that he has created over time. Feel free to use them in any mod you want.\n\nTo start, simply craft one of the master blocks. Search ‘master’ in your recipes. With a master block in your hand, hold R to choose which block you want. Since these are of decorative value, they are cheap to craft, but also have limited health. Some of these items can be interacted with. Some can be used with items, like the dart board. You can craft a dart thrower, then a few darts. Using left click you can throw a dart at the board that will stick. It comes in two colors: red and green, to allow you to play with a friend.\n\nDoes not require restart.\n\nRequires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.4 b3\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer. Works fine on servers as well.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b07ywy07n3tr05g/TelricsDecorationsPackA19.zip?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19976-telrics-a19-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Telric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/telric/)",
