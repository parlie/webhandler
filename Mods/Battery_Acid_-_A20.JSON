  "modDescription": "A recipe to extract acid from batteries in the chem station in 7 Days to die Alpha 20.\n\nThis is Ruinedworld’s first mod here. He made this for his server where acid seems to be at an all-time low. Call it bad luck, or an overuse of antacids, but this will give a better use for all those level one batteries! He figured if you have unlocked the ChemStation, which takes some time. Then this shouldn’t feel unbalanced.\n\n## Changelog\n\nChanged the file structure so that it’s not packed two folders deep and added an item.xml to define the recipe to the workbench search feature.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/ruinedworld/7DaystoDie_BatteryAcidRecipe/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/26721-battery-acid-a20/).\n\n**Credits:** Ruinedworld, Enios",
