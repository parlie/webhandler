  "modDescription": "This is a server sided mod and tweaks the [Motorcycle](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-motorcycle/) physics to reduce that horrible pop up wobble effect and allow more lean into corners.\n\nGives speed boost compared to vanilla and you can still add the vehicle mod to increase speed further.\n\n**Important Note:** If you want to include any of his vehicle mods or other mods in a ‘mod overhaul’ please do him the courtesy of asking for permission first… when given you must give the due credit to himself and any other modders that may be credited under the “Credits & Additional Credits” sections if any. Also you are not allowed to extract any unity files without his permission either, if there has been an alpha change then wait and files will be updated for the new alpha version as soon as he possibly can. Thank you!\n\n## Changelog\n\nMod updated to A20 and now you can enjoy again…\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/Ragsy2145/ragsy-a20-modlets/-/archive/main/ragsy-a20-modlets-main.zip?path=Ragsy_Motorcycle_Physics_A20)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11266-ragsy-s-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Ragsy2145](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ragsy2145/)",
