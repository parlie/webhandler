  "modDescription": "Anyone is bored of only hearing the original quest sounds and music?\n\nWell, Robeloto made a modlet that adds more to the original quest [sound](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-sound-mod/) and music. It is not much now as it is only 12 tracks, but he will keep adding. The original sounds is still there and the music chosen by the game is random. He has tried to make them as post-apocalyptic as possible. He also added level up music. Some music are from this game, like the old menu musics. And others are from Free Royalty Music (no copyright)\n\nThe beginner starter [quest](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-quests/) can annoy you with a lot of music as it is 7 subquest and one final. Let him know if any music feels out of place or are a bit too loud or too low. (using forum link)\n\nHere is the list of where Robeloto has added more music too:\n\n* quest\\_failed1\n* quest\\_started1\n* quest\\_started2\n* quest\\_started3\n* quest\\_started4\n* quest\\_subtask\\_complete1 <- complete a sub quest\n* quest\\_subtask\\_complete2\n* quest\\_master\\_complete1 <- when you complete a full quest\n* quest\\_master\\_complete2\n* levelupplayer1 <- level up sound\n* read\\_skillbook\\_final1 <- when you have read every chapter\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Robeloto/7D2D_A19_Modlets/tree/master/Robeloto_QuestMusic)** for A19  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Robeloto/7D2D_A18.4_Modlets/tree/master/Robeloto_QuestMusic)** for A18\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12229-robelotos-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Robeloto](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/robeloto/)",
