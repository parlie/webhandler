  "modDescription": "Adds six new drugs to the dev section of the creative menu:\n\n* Dev: Amnesia! – Works like the dev respec potion, except it also clears all vanilla schematics!\n* Dev: Hurt Me! – Apply numerous physical debuffs. Sprained limbs, bleeds, concussion, etc.\n* Dev: Ipecac! – Give yourself Dysentary, and reduce your food and water by 50-60%\n* Dev: Ouchie! – Give yourself an abration.\n* Dev: Slice! – Give yourself a laceration (and associated infection/bleed chance).\n* Dev: ’tis but a scratch! – Break your arm and leg.\n\nObviously, these are of no use for a normal playthrough – they’re strictly for testing mods. FreakUK needed a couple of them for a personal project, so thought he’d release them incase they’re of use to another modder.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xUv-rFCocgVcfpFu64gdfAvSSuv0e-cu/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/20806-freakuks-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [FreakUK](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/freakuk/)",
