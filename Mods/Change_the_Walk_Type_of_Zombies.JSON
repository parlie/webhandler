  "modDescription": "As many of you, Leaderdog find melee combat frustrating especially with the twitchy zombies, it feels like a RNG swing where you either get lucky or you don’t.\n\nSeeing as a zombie is a basically a slow floating soccer ball on a tee ball stand it shouldn’t be that complicated to hit.\n\nLeaderdog changed all the walktypes of 7 Days to Die zombies to the nurse’s walk, other than the spider zombies, crawlers and fatties.\n\nFor him this feels much more enjoyable. He never liked the twitchy zombies since he doesn’t think that’s a behaviour classical [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) would have. Arguably he could have just removed the twitchy walk, but he changed most to the nurse instead.\n\nIf you find the [melee](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-melee-weapons/) combat frustrating, give it a try and see what you think.\n\n[Download](https://github.com/leaderdog/7daystodie-Walktype-Modlet/raw/master/Walktype-Vanilla.rar) for Vanilla  \n[Download](https://github.com/leaderdog/7daystodie-Walktype-Modlet/raw/master/Walktype%20-%20Darkness%20Falls.rar) for [Darkness Falls Mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/darkness-falls-mod/)\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/16739-alpha-18-modlet-to-change-walktype-to-lessen-the-frustration-of-melee-combat/).\n\n**Credits:** leaderdog  \n_Special Thanks:_ SMiThaYe",
