  "modDescription": "**Neopolitan – A Collection Mod – A19.3** – Neopolitan, because who eats just the vanilla?\n\n## What Exactly Is a Collection Mod?\n\nThis is a term some others on the 7DTD Official Discord helped Shouden Kalferas formulate. A collection mod is a single mod that is combined from the code of many other mods.\n\n## What Is This Neopolitan Mod?\n\nThis Collection Mod should be considered Vanilla+, and contains the combined code of over 100 mods from a wide variety of authors. This mod collection is the same one he use on his server and all are tested, error & warning free, and work well together. The specific list of mods is outlined below. These mods are selected for their Quality of Life (QoL) improvements over vanilla game play. There are no rainbow zombies, instant crafting, super-powerful weapons, or substantial changes to game play. Anyone familiar with and who enjoys playing the vanilla game would be able to play this collection comfortably. He’s confident after playing this collection, you’ll find many or most of the mods near-requirements for any future games you play.\n\n## What if You Don’t Want All the Mods Included?\n\nWith this Neopolitan collection mod, he will also provide a zipfile download where you can download all the mods broken out individually in their original form. This will allow you to remove an individual mod from the collection.\n\n## With Over 100 Mods Included, How Do You Keep This Updated to Each Author’s Newest Changes?\n\nHe wrote a set of scripts that downloads the newest mod code for each of the mods and automatically compiles them all together to create this collection mod (and the associated zip file with all the mods separated). This way, he offload the task to each author to keep their mod updated or improved.\n\n## What About Fixes You’ve Implemented for Broken Mods?\n\nSome of the mods he used in this collection mod were either broken, had errors, or otherwise needed tuned to match the rest of the mods in this pack. For these, he does keep a separate branched set of code for the mod that contains the modified code. There are only a handful (17 at the time of this writing) that fall into this category.\n\n## List of Mods\n\n*

Most modders learn to create their own mods by looking at the work of others. In some cases, code is copied to create a new mod. Due to this, each modder is essentially standing on the shoulders of other authors. Most in the modding community, himself included, welcome others to look at how a mod was created and to use this code to any extent, provided that credit is provided back to the author whose work yours is based off of. In the spirit of this community, he has notated each author and always ensure to retain the original author’s information. This collection is meant to be nothing more than what it claims to be: A collection of his own and other people’s hard work put together in a single zip file to make it easy for players and server administrators to easy install mods into their games.
