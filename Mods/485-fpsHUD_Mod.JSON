  "modDescription": "Oof created a simple HUD mod based on his experience playing 7DTD on pvp servers. The vanilla [HUD](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-hud-mod/) lacked things that he felt would be useful for people playing in groups or fighting other players. This is not by any means a professional mod, its his first mod ever, but he does plan on keeping it up-to-date. This is completely open-sourced.\n\n## Features\n\n* Compact party system that shows the stamina of all members.\n* Navigation system that shows degrees in increments of 15 degrees for better callouts.\n* Larger tool belt blocks for increased ease of use.\n* Simple design to provide you with information without clutter. (day, time, elevation, temperature and core temperature)\n* Simple KDZ info at a glance (player kills, deaths, zombies killed)\n* Clean XP bar with level and amount of XP left for next level.\n* Food and Water bar under Health and Stamina bar.\n* Simplified Chat Box with darker background.\n* Server-side friendly – does not require players to download & install this mod on their end.\n\n## Changelog\n\n**1.2.0v – 9.23.20**\n\n* Fix issue with lag caused after opening containers\n* Updated position of xp bar as it overlapped when opening map.\n\n**1.1.0v – 8.25.20**\n\n* Center text for popup information with toolbelt\n* Toolbelt icons made slightly smaller, they were too large.\n* Center environmental information under compass\n* Make sure party component works with 8 party members.\n* Modify colors for stats HUD Bar\n* Make stealth bar larger – easier to see.\n* Add dark background for player information bars (health,stamina,food,water)\n* Modify size of toolbelt durability bar\n* Modify positioning and size of toolbelt numbers\n* Minimized code where possible\n* Party component moved up to top left corner.\n* Chat component made slightly more compact.\n\n## How to Install\n\nDownload the repository (master Branch) and move into your Mods folder. That’s it.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/lloan/7DTD-fpsHUD/archive/master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21090-fpshud-mod/).\n\n**Credits:** Oof, Sirillion, GanTheGrey, Chaos",
