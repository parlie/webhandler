  "modDescription": "This is a small patch that makes the “[Vanilla Firearms Extended](https://7daystodiemods.com/vanilla-firearms-extended/)” mod created by Sykriss compatible with the alpha 19.\n\nWhile playing I found the problem that the mod weapons could not be created in the new alpha, so I started to check the files and found the problem.\n\n## Very Important\n\nIt is required that you download and install the original mod that you will find [here](https://7daystodiemods.com/vanilla-firearms-extended/).\n\nTested with Alpha 19.1 (B8)\n\n## Instructions\n\nDownload and install the original mod normally, then download the patch and paste it inside the folder where you installed the original mod replacing. Example of the 7daystodie / mods / Vanilla Firearms Extended path. By default there you will paste the “patch” folder.\n\nI did this because I couldn’t find another weapon mod that would add as many as this, i don’t really know how to edit or create mods, just look at the xml and replace.\n\n**[Download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/gypqi025fnex1df/Config.rar/file)**\n\n**Credits:** Sykriss",
