A preview map can be found inside each zip as well.\n\n* **Alsep Island** is his original map.\n* **Atrum Island** has had the Height Map adjust a bit for deeper water, island adjustments and additions then rotated and flipped. It has all new roads and towns generated after the adjustments. _(Atrum Island is now currently running on his public server.)_\n* **Atrum\\_HM\\_BIOM:** This is the Import\\_HM.png and the biomes.png needed to generate the map to incorporate the Combo Packs if you so wish.\n* **Atrum Island-Burnt** has craters/wasteland/burned areas added.
