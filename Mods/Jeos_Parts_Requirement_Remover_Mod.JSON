  "modShortDescription": "Removes the need for specific parts for items (weapon parts, gun parts, armor parts). Increases amount of steel/iron ingots needed for crafting said items.",
  "modDescription": "This mod does a couple of things:\n\n1. Removes the need for specific parts for items ([weapon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/) parts, gun parts, armor parts)\n2. Increases amount of steel/iron ingots needed for crafting said items\n3. Removes armor/gun/weapon parts from loot pool (hopefully)\n\nIt actually sets the parts requirements to 0, so they still appear in crafting requirements but with 0 count.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-g_9VT6LMdmqBBUklj9Qlaf4nqnV72Bm/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [Jeo](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/jeo/)",
