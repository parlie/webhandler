  "modDescription": "Customizable Jukebox that holds up to 16 songs. While the Jukebox can be crafted, the songs must be obtained.\n\nThe Jukebox itself can be placed as a vehicle. Upon placing it, it won’t have any songs to play. To add [songs](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-sound-mod/) you must obtain the 16 Jukebox Vinyl. They can be found in loot or bought from the traders. The Vinyl must be placed in the Jukebox’s storage, upon which the song will be unlocked. If the Vinyl is removed the song will be locked again.\n\n## Usage\n\n* With an empty hand:  \n   * Primary Action, normal attack: Next Song.  \n   * Secondary Action, power attack: Previous Song.  \n   * To stop it, punch it while crouching.\n\n## Adding Songs\n\n* The mod doesn’t have any songs included.
