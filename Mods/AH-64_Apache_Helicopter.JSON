  "modDescription": "This mod adds a AH-64 Apache Helicopter. The controls are the same as the [gyrocopter](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/), except W will lift you upward instead of forward like a helicopter would.\n\nThe AH-64 Apache Helicopter can be unlocked with grease monkey level 5 or by finding the schematics to make the parts. You can also find the parts bundle for completing tier 5 quests. Missiles can be fired from the helicopter by pressing the right mouse button while you have the helicopter missile ammo in your inventory.
