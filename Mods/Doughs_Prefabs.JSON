  "modDescription": "Additional prefabs to load up into a RWG game, created by yours truly! Note: Some prefabs may be “inspired” by existing prefabs (Read: Doughphunghus used them as a starting point). Unless credit is given, they will be from vanilla [prefabs](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-prefab/).\n\nNote: Doughphunghus is trying to make these “compopack” compatible, meaning he is trying to follow the rules/requirements for them to be eventually added to the compopack. So these POIs shouldn’t be “unbalanced” too far from what POI’s are expected to be.\n\nNote: You may want to adjust the spawning percentage in rwgmixer.xml. He default all prefab spawning to 5%, which he has not tested to see if this is appropriate.\n\n## Current Prefabs\n\ndoughs\\_utility\\_celltower\\_01:\n\ndoughs\\_water\\_tower\\_03\\_01:\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/doughphunghus/7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a19/tree/main/Doughs-Prefabs)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Doughphunghus](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/doughphunghus/)",
