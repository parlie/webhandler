  "modDescription": "This modlet makes all [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) becomes Feral Wights or Radiated Wights. Even zombie bears and dogs can be changed.\n\nWill you take the challenge to see how long you can survive in a feral wight world?\n\n## Full Changes\n\n* Zombies are Feral Wight, with a couple changes into Radiated Wight in limited groups. You can choose to have it include zombie animals.\n* Feral Wights now have only 250 health while Radiated Wights have 500 health. You need to have some chance against them with a club after all.\n\n### Version 2\n\nFixed where zombie animals were not converted into Wights. Added an option to install to have zombie animals on or off. Just install the correct version.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1WOgPRFTQQuAQ8obsZfsuLEcGgMVetRB0)**\n\n**Credits:** Zami (It was Rusher’s idea, I just made it work.)",
