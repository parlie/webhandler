  "modDescription": "The game is a classic Battle Royale (last player alive wins). The match starts at 07:00 with a window until 09:00 for players to join. Players spawn in a random position in the map. They have freedom of movement until 12:00 of the next day, when a supply drop will fall from the sky and the first safe zone will be determined. Safe zone centers are chosen pseudo-randomly. They will not always be inside the previous safe zone radius.\n\nPlayers have until 23:59 to reach the safe zone. Between 00:00 and 11:59 players outside the safe zone will receive radiation damage. At 12:00 the zone will change position, players will regain freedom of movement and the cycle will repeat. The safe zone radius will shrink each day.\n\nAll elements that affected progression (leveling, scavenging, crafting) have been streamlined. Low tier tools, weapons and armor can be crafted from the start and the new traps and explosives should be enough for any player to protect themselves. Skills progression has been simplified, allowing players to reach maximum level in a short time. Players will have to watch for their Food and Water stats, look for a safe place to set a campfire and spend the night, seek protection from the weather and kill animals or zombies to level up. The expanded vending machines can be used to obtain specific items, but money is relatively scarce. It’s entirely possible for a careless player to die without even seeing another player, specially on higher difficulties and in the more extreme maps. Almost every obtainable item is useful in some way or can be scrapped (actually, if you find something that’s absolutely useless please report it).\n\nMatches are expected to last between 60-120 minutes. There is no way to automatically determine a win condition and there are no plans to implement one. Games will require a referee to decide who’s the last player alive. To facilitate things, players that have died will be locked in place and won’t be able to interact with the environment. There is no required interaction besides starting and finishing the game.\n\nThe core of the game is the safe zones. To implement them, Snufkin piggybacked the supply drops. For that reason supply drops no longer contain loot and are indestructible.\n\n## Features\n\n* 3 perk points per level.\n* Starting gear plus 3 perk points.\n* 30% faster movement.\n* 50% faster looting.\n* 75% faster crafting time.\n* 25% more headshot damage with archery.\n* 25% more headshot damage to humans.\n* 40% less global damage to humans.\n* 200% more water and food usage.\n* 100% more [XP](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-experience/) per kill.\n* 200% faster item degradation.\n* Increased armor movement penalty.\n* No zombie loot bag drop.\n* No XP gained from destroying/upgrading blocks.\n* Locational armor bonus: damage to each body part is reduced further depending on which armor you have equipped in said slot.\n* Upon reaching level 4 on the perks Gunslinger, Boomstick, Dead Eye, Machine Gunner, Archery and Turrets, weapons belonging to those perks will gain a chance to inflict Bleeding Wounds.\n* Burnt Zombies and [zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) on fire have a chance to set you on fire with each attack.\n* Vending machines now sell resources, ammo, mods, food and medicine.\n* All recipes are unlocked.\n* Recipes available don’t require parts and are craftable from the backpack or in a Campfire.\n* Pistol, Double Barrel Shotgun and Hunting Rifle are craftable from the start, with a fixed Quality of 1.\n* Workstations in the world are replaced by containers.\n* Gas pumps and barrels are full.\n* Ovens and Stoves work as Campfires.\n* Locked containers are now unlocked.\n* Arrows and Bolts glow like spears.\n* Bolts are craftable from Arrows and vice versa.\n* Concrete sets instantly.\n* Reduced cost of upgrading to reinforced/steel blocks.\n* Explosive Arrows and Bolts now benefit from the Demolition perk.\n* Fake Soil and Snow that work as a trapdoor.\n* Functional [vehicles](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/) spawn on the world.

Perks are no longer purchasable (1).  \n   * The level of the perks matches roughly the level at which you would unlock them.  \n   * eg. when you buy level 2 of Perception, all the perks that were purchasable at level 1 go up a level.  \n   * The crafting speed bonus of these perks was reduced:  \n         * Advanced Engineering.  \n         * Master Chef.  \n   * Some perks were removed entirely:  \n         * All book skills.  \n         * Better Barter.  \n         * Charismatic Nature.  \n         * Daring Adventurer.  \n         * Grease Monkey.  \n         * Infiltrator.  \n         * Lock Picking.  \n         * Lucky Looter.  \n         * Treasure Hunter.\n* Ammo downgrading:  \n   * HP, AP bullets and Slugs can be scrapped to normal bullets and shells.  \n   * The conversion is not 1:1\\.

To avoid this, the right panel was blocked so it’s not possible to hover over the perks. Because of this, this mod isn’t compatible with any UI mods that modify the Skills window._\n\n## Installation and Configuration\n\n* The Server and the Clients must have the mod installed and should not have any other mod in the Mods folder, with the following exceptions:  \n   * Mods that change the HUD.  \n   * Mods that increase backpack size.  \n   * Can’t guarantee compatibility with any other kind of mod.  \n   * **This mod is NOT compatible with SMX UI.**\n* Required game settings:  \n   * 24 Hour Cycle: 10, 20 or 30 Minutes.  \n   * Blood Moon Frequency: Disabled.  \n   * XP Multiplier: 100%.  \n   * Loot Abundance: 100%.  \n   * Loot Respawn Time: Disabled.  \n   * Drop On Death: Everything.  \n   * Drop On Quit: Everything.  \n   * Air Drops: Every Day.  \n   * Mark Air Drops: On.\n\n## Maps\n\n* Any [map](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/) should work for this mod, with a few requirements:  \n   * No traders.  \n   * No lakes (big or small).  \n   * No water border.  \n   * Maps bigger than 4K probably won’t work.\n* An optional download includes six 4K maps (Balanced, Snow, Wasteland, Desert, Forest, Burnt Forest).\n\n## Closing Words\n\n* This mod was only tested in 2 conditions:  \n   * A Local Multiplayer game with 2 players (me connecting to my own game).  \n   * A Dedicated Server with only 1 player.\n* It worked well on both of them, but it might not work in a real game.\n* The field that marks the safe zone is only a reference. Depending on the altitude of the supply drop, the real limit might be inside or outside the marked line. Watch out for the yellow warning if you are moving close to the border.\n* There is 1 expected bug that he was unable to trigger, but he deduce from what he has found in the code that might occur with >6 players. Apparently, with a large amount of players, two supply drops spawn instead of one. He couldn’t fix it because it never happened to him.\n\nCredits in the included “Credits.txt” file.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gzB0eTKenTUwcvc_LD9InDa_xdjMr8Hl/view?usp=sharing)** Mod  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WADl8tfeg3anboIMVILHSPSQPd1cTWVX/view?usp=sharing)** Maps  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bG-gccULXwPxTWjR86mMz9A_mVI9WLuu/view?usp=sharing)** Hotfix _(Reduces crafting time of Fort Bites.
