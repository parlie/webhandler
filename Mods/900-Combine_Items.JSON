  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod brings back the combine feature that was around in A16\\. Found in the crafting window.\n\nFrom Garson211 in regards to the combine feature: Start new map for first time, fresh everything. For that time mod must be deleted or player will have possibility to craft random level equipment at level 1 with no learned skills ect. After map/player is ready to go, turn off game instal mod and everything working perfectly fine.\n\n**Changelog**\n\n* **_(new)_** Update to A19\n* Changed the combine ability from 1,6 to 1,5 since you cant craft level 6 items anymore should hopefully fix the issue.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/stallionsden/stallionsmodlets/tree/main/Stallionsdens%20Combine%20Return)**\n\nIf you appreciate Stallionsdenâ€™s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](http://paypal.me/AnthonyCar78).\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19911-stallionsdens-and-valmars-a19-mod-thread/).\n\n**Credits:** [Stallionsden](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/stallionsden/), Various",
