  "modDescription": "Crikey That’s Alotta Content Mate!\n\nEver wanted to go down-under but couldn’t afford it? Or do you live there now and just want to see what it’s like covered in zombies? Well RadThadd’s BIG FAT Australia Map is right for you!\n\nMy map differs from other [maps](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-maps/) because here at RadThadd’s we believe “you either go BIG or go back to your country. Because we’re not accepting refugees at the moment.”\n\nThat’s right! All my maps are 16x! That’s right, even this one – more than TWICE as big as the “community” Australia map! And you can bet your bottom dollar (AUS or USD) that our maps have loads of content from points of interests, to cities, to towns, to villages and enough traders to offer more diversity than a college campus. So don’t be a wallaby! Come on down-under and down-Load this amazing map!\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lysLZub3yz8xu7WI59G2Nw5taImdgbZo/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** RadThadd",
