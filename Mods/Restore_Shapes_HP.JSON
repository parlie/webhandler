  "modDescription": "This sets all shapes back to the way they used to be with full HP based on b218\\. This is because their cost and upgrade costs did not change, only their value/Hit Points which is unfair, in his humble opinion. Who wants to pay for a full steel block and only get something weaker than concrete? Not him.\n\nDeprecated as of b237\\. b237 adds scaling cost feature (and also reverted a number of blocks to prior full strength).\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/RELXIX-7DTD/A20_XML_Modlets/tree/main/RELXIX_Shapes_RestoreShapesHP)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/25785-relxix-a20-xml-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Red Eagle LXIX](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/red-eagle-lxix/)",
