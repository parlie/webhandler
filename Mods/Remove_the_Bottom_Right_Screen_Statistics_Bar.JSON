We’re getting rid of XP pop-ups!\n\nThis mod came about from a request thread in the discussions and request forums. Originally from FailFailWin asking to remove the XP pop-ups, this is not a solution for that but it would be great to just remove the XP pop-ups and hopefully one day we get that option from The Fun Pimps.\n\nFor now thanks to Numberz who kept delving into this came up with a way to make the window transparent so we do not see notifications. Full credit to Numberz for the method and code sample.\n\n**Important Note:** If you want to include any of his vehicle mods or other mods in a ‘mod overhaul’ please do him the courtesy of asking for permission first… when given you must give the due credit to himself and any other modders that may be credited under the “Credits & Additional Credits” sections if any. Also you are not allowed to extract any unity files without his permission either, if there has been an alpha change then wait and files will be updated for the new alpha version as soon as he possibly can.
