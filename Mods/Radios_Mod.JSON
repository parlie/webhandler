  "modDescription": "A mod that adds a 3 new radios into the game. The jukebox and RA801 show video from the .mp4 files, the old radio hides the video inside. These use .mp4 files just like the video players. It’s just new models per user requests.\n\n## Installing\n\nThis is a modlet. Normal modlet install. If you swap out any of the videos, they must have the exact same name and file extension as the one you’re replacing. Those names are hard coded. It won’t like strange .mp4 encoding so keep it simple.\n\nThis is tested to work on dedi as well.\n\n## Changelog\n\nUpdated for latest experimental.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/7D2D/A19Mods/tree/master/Radios)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/8400-xyths-modlet-collection/).\n\n**Credits:** [Xyth](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/xyth/)",
