  "modDescription": "Welcome to Ultimate Vehicle mod (UVM). This is a BETA release.\n\nThese are heavily optimized low poly vehicles that will spawn in the world, on roads and in prefabs, that can either be harvested for parts like vanilla, or upgraded to a working vehicle if you have found or crafted UVM\\_Vehicleaccessories item and the UVM\\_impactwrench to do so. You cant pick up the shell to take back to your base or keep in inventory. You must have the parts to upgrade the vehicle then collect.\n\nYou will either need to find the schematic, or unlock the grease monkey perk to craft. The recipe for the vehicle accessories consists of:\n\n```\n<ingredient name=\"carBattery\" count=\"1\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"vehicleWheels\" count=\"4\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"smallEngine\" count=\"1\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"ammoGasCan\" count=\"7500\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"resourceMechanicalParts\" count=\"16\"/>\n```\n\nThe Impact Wrench is in loot like the nail gun. You can find the schematic in loot also. The recipe for the [impact wrench](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/) consists of:\n\n```\n<ingredient name=\"resourceForgedSteel\" count=\"20\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"resourceMechanicalParts\" count=\"20\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"resourceDuctTape\" count=\"2\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"resourceScrapPolymers\" count=\"10\"/>\n<ingredient name=\"resourceSpring\" count=\"5\"/>\n```\n\nUpgrading uses a specific hit location on the vehicle, the front RIGHT headlight area when looking at the vehicle. (reasons)\n\nA lot of time has been spent on the physics and speed balancing of the vehicles in comparison to vanilla. You can still have the vanilla vehicles by vanilla means, however. Im not that mean (yet)\n\nCommon vehicles are generally the slowest, while the super cars will have you flying across the map (DUST2DEATH has based this on the speed of his PC loading chunks, keep in mind he use his biome packs etc.)\n\nThere are 46 Base [vehicles](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-vehicles/) included in this release. 31 civilian vehicles and the remaining are military (see below)\n\nDUST2DEATH recommend a new game as they will not spawn into already explored areas in existing games. Military vehicles will ONLY spawn in military prefabs. Pray to RNGesus.\n\n**The Vehicles**\n\nThe spawning ranges from common, uncommon and rare.\n\n* Sedans (common)\n* 4×4’s (common)\n* Vans (common)\n* Sports Cars (uncommon)\n* Super Cars (rare)\n* Special (mixed)\n* Military Cars\n* Military Trucks\n* Military Special\n\nIn future updates (dont ask for a timeline) you will be able to upgrade base vehicles into upgraded “Mad Max” inspired vehicles with bumpers, armor, engines, wheels, NOS for that extra zombie killing potential.\n\nThere are known things (things, not issues) so DUST2DEATH wont list them (just visual stuff at the moment).\n\nFurthermore DUST2DEATH could not have done this alone. There was large contributions and help from:\n\n* Ragsy\n* Haidrgna\n* KhaineGB\n* Guppycur\n\nIf he forgot anyone, he’s sorry, its been since October…\n\n**Beta 2 Uploaded**\n\n* Adds Impact Wrench to grease monkey perk\n* Progression unlocks of impact wrench and accessories\n* Loot on shells civvy/military\n* Car head light and brake light visuals\n* Adds flashing lights to emergency vehicles\n* Localization by Chiko and Adredan\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/DUST2DEATH/uvm/-/archive/master/uvm-master.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/18315-uvm-ultimate-vehicle-mod-foundation-base-beta-release/).\n\n**Credits:** [DUST2DEATH](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/dust2death/)",
