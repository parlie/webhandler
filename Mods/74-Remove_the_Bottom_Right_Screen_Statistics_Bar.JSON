We’re getting rid of XP pop-ups!\n\nThis mod came about from a request thread in the discussions and request forums. Originally from FailFailWin asking to remove the XP pop-ups, this is not a solution for that but it would be great to just remove the XP pop-ups and hopefully one day we get that option from The Fun Pimps.\n\nFor now thanks to Numberz who kept delving into this came up with a way to make the window transparent so we do not see notifications. Full credit to Numberz for the method and code sample.\n\n[Download](https://gitlab.com/Ragsy2145/other-7-days-to-die-mods-and-modlets/-/archive/master/other-7-days-to-die-mods-and-modlets-master.zip?path=Remove_RH_Stats_Bar)\n\nThis goes great with [Random Getter Upper](https://7daystodiemods.com/random-getter-upper/) mod.\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/11266-ragsy-s-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Ragsy2145](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ragsy2145/), Numberz",
