Feel free to use it as much as you want for personal use, but if you want to include his work in another mod/overhaul first contact him for permission.\n\n## Changelog\n\nWell the particle thing kept having issues.

Remove old mods and use this new one and should be fixed.\n\n**Alpha 19 Version**  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fDJ43RizjiOIPZ6cHTzGoUl2515GlJJc/view?usp=sharing)** for **A19**  \n**Alpha 18 Versions**  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1asSD3YMniTThEleyJ31m3iWHAGGHtz03)** Brighter Color Set for **A18**  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Gcm-XzsRpZuqG_wgMPdy7s75ByhSXuDH)** Darker Color Set for **A18**  \n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11AY3sB5ow44c4fo01pm6FktOIKBWtdej)** Small Medieval Set for **A18**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/10892-new-zombie-textures-mumpfy/).\n\n**Credits:** Mumpfy",
