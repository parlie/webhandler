For this reason, the mod should be installed on both servers and clients.\n\n### Re-Use of New Assets\n\nThe icon images are derivative works of The Fun Pimps original images. Khzmusik does not claim any rights over these images.\n\nYou may only re-use the images under the same terms and conditions that you would use the original images from The Fun Pimps.\n\n## Possible Improvements\n\nBetter localization – He need help with this!\n\n## Changelog\n\n* **_(new)_** Decrease perk level requirements for preserved and canned goods crafting.\n* Preserved snowberries cure dysentery (for consistency with [Snowberry Love](https://7daystodiemods.com/snowberry-love/))\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/karlgiesing/7d2d-a19-modlets/-/archive/master/7d2d-a19-modlets-master.zip?path=khzmusik_Preserved_Foods)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24348-a19-khzmusiks-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Khzmusik](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/khzmusik/)",
