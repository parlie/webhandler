  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod adds 20 craftable variant blocks full of decorative [building](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-building-materials/) blocks([block list](https://github.com/andrough/7D2DvA18/tree/master/aDVReadme)).\n\nDozens and dozens of vanilla blocks categorized mostly by their component materials. Too many to list in an unobnoxious way here, so Andrough made the ReadMe that is linked.\n\nPossible issue is balance. He tried to balance the recipes towards the high end of the less common ingredients with additional ingredients to cover cost/context all while keeping the added number of blocks/[recipes](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-recipes/) down. Itâ€™s possible he missed some balancing-he is open to suggestion here.\n\nThere are some blocks available in the variant helpers that were already available in game, but he thought it would be convenient to group them together anyway.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/andrough/7D2DvA18/tree/master/ADV/androughDecoVariants)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/16187-andrough-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Andrough](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/andrough/)",
