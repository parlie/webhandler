  "modDescription": "This mod adds five new books for the player to find in loot or purchase from a trader. These [books](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-books/) will slowly make the stun baton more useful in more situations.\n\n* Book 1: While at full charge, gain 15% movement speed.\n* Book 2: Using a charge makes nearby allies deal 30% extra damage for 2 seconds.\n* Book 3: Causes your shocks to also ignite the enemy.\n* Book 4: You have a 20% chance to recharge your baton when you use a charge.\n* Book 5: Full charge attacks have an extra 5 meter reach.\n* Book Set Completion: Enemies hit with a full charge will spread shock and fire to all other enemies within 3 meters.\n\nMay require restart. Any mod that touches the progression system has a very high chance to corrupt the data and cause your character to drop back to level 1\\. You’ll lose any perk points you’ve spent as well. So use with caution!\n\nRequires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.4 b3\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer. Works fine on servers as well.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7u9bc4c3fvmaxld/TelricsStunBatonPerksA19.zip?dl=1)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19976-telrics-a19-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Telric](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/telric/)",
