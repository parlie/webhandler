  "modDescription": "This little mod adds health bars over zombies. The health bars appear once the zombie takes any source of damage. It will display the % of health remaining. This works on damage and healing. It will display based on tags, so if you’re adding this to custom zombies, be sure to check the buffs.xml to see all the tags used.\n\nThis mod adds buffs to the [zombie](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-zombies/) male template. If other mods adds buffs directly to that, it could possibly cause issues.\n\nDoes not require restart.\n\nRequires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.2 b3\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer. Works fine on servers as well.\n\n## Changelog\n\n* Telric took some time to rewrite this mod to be more compatible with other mods. The old version would add a property to the zombie entity class directly, which could cause issues with other mods that do the same. So he redid it to attach to the player’s status update buff so it will always be active on the player, then transfer to the target on hit. This new version also works on most animals. The old version is still available just as a backup incase a breaking bug is found.\n\n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/32jy2t0xjj5h3m3/Telrics%20Health%20Bars%202.0A19.zip?dl=1)** 2.0 for **A19**\\*  \n**[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvpeifdfcuqb4d8/Telrics%20Health%20Bars%202.0.zip?dl=1)** 2.0 for **A18**\\*  \n_(\\*This is the revised version.
