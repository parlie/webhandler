  "modDescription": "This mod only does one thing!\n\nIt increases scraping speed by 10x, this applies to iron/brass/lead/clay/glass/wood.\n\nSince it was created as a patch, it should work with almost any other mod and should work for future 7d2d releases, unless they change something major.\n\nSince it contains only xml files, itâ€™s EAC safe and server-side. no need for client to download it.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-j7FD7ID-n1pMEH3NbNFyk5Yu_a3OIJb/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Credits:** [Jeo](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/jeo/)",
