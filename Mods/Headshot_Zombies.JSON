  "modDescription": "This 7 Days to Die mod is a variation on [Insane Zombies](https://7daystodiemods.com/insane-zombies/). Instead of increasing the amount of hit points, make body hits do only 20% damage, plus modifiers. The modifiers can easily make the damage decent, since he had no way of reducing the damage after all modifiers. The advantage is that bleeding, burning and explosion damage are unaffected. In addition, he has added 200% to headshot damage, so you start at 4x instead of 2x. Like on Insane Zombies, however, all zombies do 2.5x as much damage as normal.\n\n**[Download](https://github.com/dcsobral/7d2d/releases/download/3.0.0/Dan.s.Headshot.Zombies-1.0.0.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17350-dcsobrals-mods/).\n\n**Credits:** [Dcsobral](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/dcsobral/)",
