  "modDescription": "Door Smasher Mod modlet. Since using compopack AnsontheToad grew tired of spending so much time beating through [doors](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-doors/). So he made this it gives 200% damage bonus to doors on whatever melee [tool](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-tools/) you put it on he prefer the steel axe. An unintended side effect is it also works on safes. Mod and Schematic can be found in loot and at trader.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1lZH99S4EV80tPnOPqwlPILr9e7wFTpz7)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/20895-toads-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [AnsontheToad](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/ansonthetoad/)",
