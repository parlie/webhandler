  "modDescription": "Is the default death screen too short? Want to stare at your dead character being eaten by zombies for longer? This 7 Days to Die mod is for you! Conveniently comes in 30s, 60s, 90s, and 120s options so you can choose how long you get to consider how bad you messed up!\n\nLooking for ways to improve your PvP experience? This mod does that! No longer will you have to suffer on PvP servers with people instantly [respawning](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-respawn/) with full health and trying to kill you right after you just killed them. Now you’ll have some time to loot their body and get away before they come back with a vengeance.\n\nThis mod is a simple xml patch, and thus only needs to be installed serverside or on game host’s client. The code will be pushed to all who connect.\n\n**[Download](http://www.mediafire.com/file/l5hunlq4jlkn32u/Nosoren%2527s_Respawn_Timer_Increase.zip/file)**\n\n**Credits:** [Nosoren](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/nosoren/)",
