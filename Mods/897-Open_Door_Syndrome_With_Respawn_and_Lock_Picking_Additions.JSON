  "modDescription": "This mod does the same thing opened door syndrome does except allows the respawn of containers thru out the world and lock picking additions.\n\n## Notes\n\n* This makes all loot containers respawn that have a open version and randomlooter block\n* A stage has 63 ticks before it goes to the next stage.\n* Roughly 7 hours (441 minutes) before a container respawns.\n* Changed the possibility of a full container to spawn to be 100% due to the possibility of one going a really long time of respawning. IE: A container goes thru 441 minutes then the randomlooter of that container picks a empty again therefore you would have to wait another 441 minutes to possibly get a full container and ofc the cycle would repeat.\n\n## Fixed\n\n* Fixed pillcase not opening once looted\n* Fixed mircrowave destroying on open\n\n## Warning\n\n* Not compatible with [Open Door Syndrome](https://7daystodiemods.com/open-door-syndrome/).\n* Disregard yellow text that can be seen in console. Those warnings are nothing important. Just means there is a repeating cycle of down/upgrades. x goes to y goes to z goes to x.\n\n## Changelog\n\nOpen Door Syndrome With Respawn and Lock Picking Additions updated.\n\n**Fixed:**  \nBedmade1 infinite downgrade loop unable to destroy  \nIn regards to Nuclear Power mod.\n\n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/stallionsden/stallionsmodlets/tree/main/Stallionsdens%20Open%20Door%20Syndrome%20With%20Respawn)** Open Door Syndrome With Respawn  \n**[Download](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/stallionsden/stallionsmodlets/tree/main/AStallionsdensOpenDoorSyndromeWithRespawnLockPickingAdditions)** Open Door Syndrome With Respawn and Lock Picking Additions\n\nIf you appreciate Stallionsdenâ€™s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](http://paypal.me/AnthonyCar78).\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19911-stallionsdens-and-valmars-a19-mod-thread/).\n\n**Credits:** [Stallionsden](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/stallionsden/)  \n_Special Thanks:_ Telric",
