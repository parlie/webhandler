  "modDescription": "Tired of boiled meat, cornbread and stale garbage can takeout? So am I. I set out one day across the wasteland to bring you things like “The Golden Logs of Enlightenment”, Cocoa Covered Ants, Ma’s Raisin [Cookies](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-food/), and even, dammit, FK’in Sno-Balls. It’s a mod I created for 7 Days To Die on my own dedicated server and decided to share it with the rest of us sorry lots trying to make a way in the apocalypse. Enjoy.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJubCueklopbS183AbK_sDgSzfVFZwRa/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nIf you appreciate Zombieland (LOL)’s work and you want to show support, use this [donate link](https://paypal.me/ancientwolfgr?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US).\n\n**Credits:** Zombieland (LOL), War3zuk",
