  "modDescription": "This mod adds a [robot](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-robots/) companion to help carry your stuff. Heâ€™s not perfect, but he will do his very best to keep up with you. You will occasionally have to smack him to teach him who the boss is though.\n\nRequires finding a schematic to learn, and craftable on the workbench.\n\nIf he dies, he will stay the same length of time as your [backpack](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-backpack/), so that you still have time to retrieve your stuff.\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/guppycur/guppymods/-/archive/master/guppymods-master.zip?path=Guppycur%27s_Robot_Dog)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9144-guppycurs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/)",
