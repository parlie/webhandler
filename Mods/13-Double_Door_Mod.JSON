  "modDescription": "This mod adds double doors to the 7 Days to Die. There are some inherent issues with useable colliders (press to interact) and multi-dim (one block that takes up more space than one block) blocks, so Guppycur had to use some hackery. Basically he added a collider on the ground to the open side of the door. See the video for details.\n\nWith this double door mod the 7DTD game will become more enjoyable. Add your favorite [doors](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-doors/) to your base and enjoy.\n\n**Note:** Guppycur has not added custom sounds for doors.\n\n**Changelog**\n\n* Updated mod to include a 1×2 swinging jail door and a 3×3 sliding door set.\n* Added recipes and made the material hard metal (it was glass, tee hee).\n\n**[Download](https://gitlab.com/guppycur/guppymods/-/archive/master/guppymods-master.zip?path=Guppycur%27s_Door_Blocks)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/9144-guppycurs-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Guppycur](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/guppycur/)  \n_Additional Credits:_ Mumphy, Chiko",
