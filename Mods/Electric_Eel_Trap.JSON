  "modDescription": "This mod is great for defending against bloodmoon hordes. Make a moat, it has to be made of cube blocks otherwise it will leak, with cube blocks around your base. Place log spikes at the bottom of the moat with one block layer of eel [traps](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-traps/) over the log spikes and then setup a bridge of sorts to get between the moat an base entrance. The only problem is looting the moat.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r7SeEk0DqdYOUt0nwhfDhId5yEjdsOMU/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21494-alucards-modlets/).\n\n**Credits:** [Noisy Pants](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/noisy-pants/)",
