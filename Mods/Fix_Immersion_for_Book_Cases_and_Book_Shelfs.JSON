  "modDescription": "Kronons really disliked how when you loot the books piles they disappear after you loot them, but the shelves/cases did not. He think it’s more immersive by having the book cases, and book shelves disappear after you loot them. Also makes the game harder.\n\nKronons can also make a version where none of them disappear after looting, but that’s a bit immersion breaking.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1JUsOJf4CRjl1kIVqzMcQpuWxfcjzuIp-)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/19604-fix-immersion-for-book-cases-and-book-shelfs/).\n\n**Credits:** [Kronons](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/kronons/)",
