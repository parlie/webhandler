  "modDescription": "Have some nice doors instead of the normal crap! Requires a workbench to craft these, though. Survive in style. Simple mod that allows you to craft the other [doors](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-doors/) that are in the game. These can also be upgraded after crafting with the board slats, etc. But who would want to cover up such a nice door.\n\nAlso allows you to craft a Door Knob, since you need one to craft these doors. Canâ€™t have a nice door without a door knob!\n\nServer side friendly, so just drop in and go.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1uV8y5kl2n4cRerpbkr2VW0QcBNRvtLAV)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/22349-craft-doors/).\n\n**Credits:** [Iceburg71](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/iceburg71/)",
