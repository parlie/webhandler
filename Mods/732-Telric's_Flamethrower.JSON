  "modDescription": "This mod adds a flamethrower [weapon](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-weapons/). You can find it in loot, craft it, or buy it from traders. It cannot be modified, except for dyes and itâ€™s own modifiers. These modifiers change the color of the flames when equipped. The flamethrower will also deal 75% additional damage to wood blocks.\n\nDoes not require restart.\n\nRequires client to install as well as server.\n\nTested and works with Alpha 19.4 b7\n\nRecommended to be played single player or multiplayer, though it has not been tested in MP nor on servers.\n\nKudos to the creator of this awesome particle system!
