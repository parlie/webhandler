  "modDescription": "Credits to Lam for framework of this mod. When used with [Lam’s Master Mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/lams-mods/), adds a new perk, Crafting Tier, under the Lam tree that adds 1 crafting quality per tier. So on a new game, 1 rank will make all your weapons craft at level 2\\. Stacks with default [perks](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-perks/), so a Tier 1 in Deadeye and Tier 1 in Crafting Tier will produce Level 3 Perception Weapons.\n\nWith this mod, you can craft level 6 weapons, but it’s really for mods that grant workbenches the old combine function. Without this mod, you will only be able to combine items up to a certain level. Usually 4 or 2\\. Now you can go all the way to tier 6 if you so desire. Costs 2 points per rank until rank 3, in which it becomes 3 points.\n\n**[Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZybtqLEDBxih62sbRCYVQ3v4LnsUbhW/view?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23952-tristams-hodgepodge-o-mods/).\n\n**Credits:** [Tristam](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/tristam/), Lammetje",
