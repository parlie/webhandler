  "modDescription": "Another tiny mod. Boidster was playing around and it worked; maybe it’ll be useful to someone.\n\nRight-click with murky water jar onto water or any terrain block to “empty” the jars. Will not add water into the terrain or re-fill “holes” in water. Just empties the jars.\n\n**[Download](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1OJaD2IZL_dRTPr-2vTFjble0VL3B5lVR)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21508-modlet-to-allow-emptying-of-murky-water-jars/).\n\n**Credits:** [Boidster](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/boidster/)",
