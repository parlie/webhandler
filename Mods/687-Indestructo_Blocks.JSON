  "modDescription": "This mod is intended to let admins build public horde bases that cannot be damaged by zombies or players.\n\nOnce installed, open the Creative Menu, turn Dev Blocks on and search for “Indestructo”. You’ll find one multi-shape block that will create any block shape, including:\n\n* Iron Bars (standard & centered)\n* Vault [Doors](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-doors/) (powered & manual)\n* Vault Hatches (powered & manual)\n* Bridges (powered & manual)\n* Steel Garage Door (powered & manual)\n* Double Doors (powered & manual)\n* Rolling Garage Door\n* Spikes (removed in A17, restored here)\n\n**Known Bug:** Demolishers can damage the [spikes](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/7-days-to-die-spikes/). Will update if NerdyHippie find a fix for that.\n\n**Warning:** All materials are made of bedrock. The only way to destroy these blocks once placed is to remove their structural support and let gravity take them down. Use with caution.\n\n**[Download](http://nerdyhippie.com/7days/IndestructoBlocks.zip)**\n\nThe forum topic of the mod is [here](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/23743-indestructoblocks/).\n\n**Credits:** [NerdyHippie](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/nerdyhippie/)",
