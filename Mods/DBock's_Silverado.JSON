Found at an untouched dealership, this brand new Silverado will bring you so much joy, you will forget there are even zombies nearby.\n\nCurrently, the model only includes a brand new model. A dirty model may come later.\n\nI plan on adding a few things to this model, so standby for updates!\n\n**[Download](https://mega.nz/file/Hno2GSTD#mi29ih65nLjJ9XxJJtgvJh-48cTtohjphS3biYxOxOo)**\n\n**Credits:** [DBock](https://7daystodiemods.com/tag/dbock/)",
